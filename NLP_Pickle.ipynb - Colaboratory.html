We introduced the new \nposition of a Chief Sustainability Officer and we created an \ninfrastructure that will enable us to pursue our sustainability efforts \neven more efficiently across our global operations. Our operating \nentities in more than 70 countries now have mandatory ESG \ntargets. We further emphasized the sustainability goals within our \ncompensation structures and incentive systems for managers Œ \nespecially members of the Board of Management. And we have \ncontributed and then in early 2021 committed to the Stakeholder \nCapitalism Metrics developed by the World Economic Forum. \nThese˜metrics establish a uniform basis for assessing companies™ \nESG commitments across multiple industries and countries. \nThis˜should put considerably more pressure on businesses to \nmake˜progress in ESG value creation Œ a move we encourage.\nIn 2020 Allianz employees and Allianz entities around the world \nwere also engaged in addressing societal issues Œ whether by \ndelivering programs and products to cover risks for vulnerable \nmembers of society or personal assistance. Examples are initiatives \nto help people of color in the aftermath of the distressing incidents \nin Minneapolis˚ aid for farmers in Australia whose livelihoods had \nbeen destroyed by the horrific bush fires˚ or support for people \nsuffering mentally from the coronavirus environment, for instance \nin˜the United Kingdom, but also in other parts of the world. \nOne aspect of our sustainability strategy that is especially important \nto us is helping to address climate change to meet the targets under \nthe Paris Agreement. Here we™re relying heavily on cooperation, \nand˜want to make rapid advances in-house as well.\nIn 2020, we achieved our goal of reducing our greenhouse \nemissions per Allianz employee by 30 percent worldwide compared \nto a 2010 baseline. We™re aiming for a further 30 percent reduction \nby 2025. We™re also a part of the RE100 business initiative, and aim \nfor all of our entities™ electricity needs to be met from renewable \nsources by 2023.\nWe know that our reach as one of the world™s leading financial \nservice providers goes hand in hand with a special responsibility. \nAnd in concert with other major asset owners and the United \nNations, we™re applying that leverage to encourage investments \nŒ including our own Œ toward net-zero emissions by 2050. In fact, \nwe™re one of the driving forces in the U.N.-convened Net Zero Asset \nOwner Alliance. By end of 2020, 33 pension funds and insurance \ncompanies had joined us in this initiative. Taken all together we \nhave more than $ 5 trillion in assets under management. \nWe made our plans even more specific in January 2021 by setting \nourselves ambitious interim targets. By 2025 we aim to reduce \nemissions for selected investment classes in our portfolio of clients™ \nmoney by 25 percent compared to 2019. To achieve this we™re \nworking with companies in every sector whose securities we hold \nin these portfolios. And we™re supporting them in carrying out their \nown net-zero greenhouse gas strategies, provided those strategies \nare persuasive.\nLet me also mention my own involvement as Co-Chair of the U.N.™s \nGlobal Investors for Sustainable Development initiative, in which \n30 top leaders from the financial industry have joined forces to \nadvance sustainability in our sector. This is another sign of our \ncooperatively oriented dedication to slowing climate change. \nLast but not least in early 2021, our Supervisory Board has decided \nto put an increased focus on sustainability by establishing a formal \nSustainability Committee to oversee the Group™s ESG agenda.\nWe want to make use of the next years to contribute to a more \nsustainable world, and help shape change. \nI hope you™ll enjoy reading this report. And perhaps you™ll also \nfeel encouraged to make your own contribution toward a more \nsustainable world.Chairman of the Board of Management \n Allianz SE\n2020 was a challenging year for people and businesses \naround the world. Yet, Allianz stood reliably at the \nside of its clients, its employees, its shareholders, \nand˜the society as a whole. Drawing on that strength \nand resilience, we are taking the pandemic as an \nopportunity to incorporate sustainability as an \neven more central element of our strategy and our \nvalue˜chain.\nSustainability, in every dimension, is one of our top priorities. \nWe˜believe that sustainability will enable us to realize our potential \nfor growth and value Œ while at the same time contributing to a \nfuture that™s worth living for all of us. To do justice to the urgency \nand complexity of the challenges we face, we once again increased \nour sustainability efforts. We closely cooperated with additional \npartners in business, science, and government to lend the greatest \npossible efficacy to our sustainability initiatives.\n01Introduction\n01.1 Message from the CEO\n01.2 What we do01.3 Emerging risks\n01.4 Purpose and strategy\n01.5 2020 Sustainability highlights02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nGRI˛˝˙-˛ˆ03\n01.2\n What we do\nAllianz has stood by its customers for over 130 years, \nprotecting and helping them achieve their goals in life \nand in business.

The structure of Allianz Group \nreflects both our business segments and geographical regions. \nBusiness activities are organized by product and type of service: \ninsurance activities, asset management activities, and corporate \nand other activities. Due to differences in products, risks, and capital \nallocation, insurance activities are further divided into Property-\nCasualty and Life/Health categories. There were no significant \nchanges to our organizational structure in 2020.\nInsurance operations\nŁ The Property-Casualty business segments offer an extensive line \nof products and services in all insurance business lines, designed \nto protect customers against risks. These include motor, accident, \nproperty, general liability, travel insurance and assistance services.\nŁ The Life/Health business segment addresses the health and \nwell-being protection needs of our clients worldwide. We offer \ninternational health, life and disability insurance, as well as a \nwide˜range of health and protection services.\nMost insurance markets are served by local Allianz companies. \nKey markets (in terms of premiums) for both Property-Casualty \nand Life/Health insurance are Germany, France, Italy and the \nU.S. Some business lines Œ such as Allianz Global Corporate &amp; \nSpecialty (AGCS), Allianz Partners (AP) and Credit Insurance Œ \nare˜run globally.\nAsset managementWe are one of the largest asset managers in the world, managing \nassets with active investment strategies.

Although we believe our risk \nmanagement framework is sound Œ for example with \nrespect to our solvency position and internal control \nsystem Œ we also recognize that the risk landscape is \nconstantly evolving due to a combination of internal \nand external factors. For the continued success of our \nbusiness it is important to recognize these factors at \nan early stage and adapt accordingly. Adaptions in \nresponse to emerging risks might include adjustments \nto the characteristics and mix of products, updates \nin the design and deployment of IT systems, the \nintroduction of new risk limits or a myriad of other \nmeasures that collectively constitute our business \nand˜risk strategy.\nThe following provides some examples of current emerging risks \nfacing our business, including their potential (adverse) impacts \nand˜how Allianz is responding to these risks.\n01.3\n Emerging risks\n01Introduction\n01.1 Message from the CEO\n01.2 What we do01.3 Emerging risks\n01.4 Purpose and strategy\n01.5 2020 Sustainability highlights02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nRisk 1: PandemicContext\nFrom a broad perspective the current COVID-19 pandemic is much \nmore than an isolated incident generating short-term and long-\nterm threats towards economic and societal well-being. While˜the \ndevastation wrought by COVID-19 has undoubtedly been severe \nand cannot be understated, it may at the same time be objectively \nobserved as simply the latest data point evidencing an increase in \nboth the number and diversity of epidemic events over the prior 30 \nyears˚ a trend that is expected to continue in-step with an increasingly \ninterconnected world and continued environmental˜degradation.\n1Against this background, Allianz recognizes that epidemics will \nincreasingly be a recurring threat for our business going forward.\nImpact and Mitigation\nA major global pandemic carries potential to trigger significant \nimpacts on our business in a variety of ways, as currently evidenced \nby the consequences of COVID-19. Chief amongst these are: \nŁ Financial market impacts triggered by economic uncertainty Œ \ndue to pandemic mitigation measures such as lockdowns and \ntravel restrictions Œ may trigger a decline in the value of our \ncompany™s financial assets and insurance portfolios, thereby \nadversely impacting our solvency position and profitability˚\nŁ Pandemic-related events covered by our insurance products \nmay˜result in an increase in insurance losses and a corresponding \ndecline in our underwriting results˚ and \nŁ Public health and safety measures intended to combat pandemic \noutbreaks, such as lockdowns requiring rapid shifts to work-\nfrom-home models, may result in disruptions to internal \noperations˚ alternatively, additional costs may be required to \nsupport continued operations, such as additional IT costs, costs \nattributable to overtime or external resources to account for \nill employees, or˜supplemental child care benefits to support \nemployees whose˜children are unable to attend school, day-\ncare,˜etc.\nAlready prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our risk management \nframework was well-positioned to deal with a wide variety of risks \nto our business, irrespective of whether these risks were triggered \nby˜a pandemic or another event. For example:\nŁ Stress tests are used to evaluate the adequacy of our solvency \nposition and profitability following major financial market \nmovements, under various assumptions for shifts in market \nparameters like interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and \nreal estate values, credit spreads, etc.\nŁ Accumulations of underwriting exposures within certain lines of \nbusinesses or coverages are monitored and potential losses are \nevaluated under various scenarios, including pandemic scenarios.\nŁ Processes are in place to ensure we are able to adapt to sudden, \nunexpected disruptions towards our operations, particularly with \nrespect to those critical business processes serving customers \nor ensuring legal and regulatory compliance. This includes the \nimplementation of an IT framework that enables employees \nto work from home with full access to the data, systems and \nconferencing software available when physically located in \nthe office.\nUsing the experience and lessons from the current pandemic we \nhave continued to further adapt our risk management framework \nto ensure we are adequately prepared for any potential future \npandemic events.\n1   \n‚Outbreak Readiness and Business Impact Protecting Lives and Livelihoods across the \nGlobal Economy™˚ white paper published by the World Economic Forum in collaboration \nwith the Harvard Global Health Institute.\nGRI05\n01.3 Emerging risks\n01Introduction\n01.1 Message from the CEO\n01.2 What we do01.3 Emerging risks\n01.4 Purpose and strategy\n01.5 2020 Sustainability highlights02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nRisk 2: Climate ChangeContext\nWithout question we accept that climate change will materially \nimpact the earth™s natural environment and, by extension, trigger \nadverse societal and economic impacts felt around the globe. \nAs˜an insurer, we recognize corresponding climate change risks and \nopportunities that can be realized already today and will continue \nto increase over the mid and long-term. These can for instance be \nacute and chronic physical impacts on property or human health, \nsuch as warming temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea \nlevels, intensifying heatwaves and droughts or a change in vector-\nborne diseases. Risks and opportunities also result from the cross-\nsectoral structural change stemming from the transition towards \na low-carbon economy. These include changes in climate policy, \ntechnology, or market sentiment, and impact thereof on the market \nvalue of financial assets, as well as impact resulting from climate \nchange litigation. Impact and Mitigation\nClimate change impacts Allianz™s business in two key ways: firstly \nthrough insurance policies, e.g. covering health impacts and other \nlosses like property damage, and secondly through changes in the \nsectors and business models it underwrites. Furthermore, Allianz is \naffected as a large-scale institutional investor. It has significant stakes \nin various economies, companies, infrastructure and real estate that \nare, or will be, affected by the physical impact of climate change \nand by the transition to a low-carbon economy, which can directly \ninfluence the ability of assets to generate long-term value.\nWe address immediate risks from climate change factors following the \nmanagement approach for the primary underlying risks, e.g. building \non our long-term expertise in the modeling of extreme weather events, \nor analyzing emission profiles of our proprietary investments. On a \nforward-looking basis we consider risks from climate change factors \nunder emerging risks, where we closely monitor the development of \nthe˜risk landscape supported by selective analysis on our portfolios. \n  \nFor further details, see section 05, Allianz™s climate-related \nfinancial disclosure.\nRisk 3: Regulatory Uncertainty\nContext\nAs a global insurer and asset manager we operate within a heavily \nregulated industry, further compounded by the complexity of \nhaving customers in more than 70 countries, each with its own set \nof laws and regulations. These rules effectively cut across all areas \nof our business and heavily influence, for example: the features \nof our products as well as how and the conditions under which \nthese products are distributed˚ the investments we are allowed \nto purchase with the money entrusted to us by our customers˚ the \ncontent and presentation of publicly disclosed financial and non-\nfinancial information˚ the gathering and processing of customer \ndata˚ or the design of our internal operations and internal \ncontrol systems.\nEach year numerous new or changed regulations come into force \nor are under consideration by rule-making bodies. This˜constant \nstream of regulations, whether on a global, regional or country-\nspecific basis presents challenges that extend beyond the mere \nquestion of regulatory compliance, having the potential to \nultimately impact our business strategy, capital requirements, \nfinancial results, operations, risk appetite, governance and \nmanagement accountability.\nImpact and Mitigation\nThe final rules contained in new or changed regulations often \ntimes are developed over the course of many years. Usually this \nbegins with statements by politicians or regulators regarding a \nregulatory need, which are then followed by a legislative process \nof˜proposals, amendments, public consultations and interpretations \nŒ such that the final rules are often times not fully clear until \nshortly before regulations come into effect. Combining this typical \ndevelopment view with the absolute volume of regulations facing \nour business means that at any given moment our company \nis exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty due to various \nforthcoming laws resting somewhere on the spectrum of this \nlegal˜development lifecycle. \nThe European Union™s sustainable finance agenda is one prime \nexample of regulatory uncertainty, with its potential to ultimately \nhave a substantial impact on Allianz e.g. in the areas of corporate \ngovernance, investment management, product development, sales, \nand reporting.\nTo manage this regulatory uncertainty risk we employ a multi-\nfaceted approach. A dedicated team of regulatory experts within \nour company continuously monitors the regulatory landscape \nto identify at an early stage any potential emerging regulations \nthat may have a substantial impact on our business. In the early \nand middle phases, typically two to five years in advance of any \nproposed regulations taking effect, this team establishes and \nengages the impacted departments within the organization \nand frequently participates in consultation processes conducted \nby regulatory bodies. In parallel, the team raises emerging \nregulatory topics towards the compliance function which \noversees legal change processes and ensures information of \nimpacted departments.\nIn the later phases, as details of any emerging regulations become \nmore concrete, oversight of regulatory developments increasingly \nshifts to the impacted departments. These departments begin to \noutline and prepare for implementation of the exact organizational \nchanges needed to comply with the law, for example with respect \nto internal processes or external reporting.\nOnce a law takes effect it is the responsibility of the impacted \ndepartment to ensure full adherence, which is further monitored \nthrough the compliance function.\n  \nFor further details, see also section 04.3 Regulatory and pubic affairs.\n06\n01Introduction\n01.1 Message from the CEO\n01.2 What we do01.3 Emerging risks\n01.4 Purpose and strategy\n01.5 2020 Sustainability highlights02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n01.4\n Purpose and strategy\nOur Group strategy is designed to maintain our \nposition as one of the world™s leading international \ninsurance and asset management companies. We˜aim \nto be the most reliable and caring in our industry \nwhile achieving best-in-class in customer satisfaction, \nemployee engagement and sustainability. \nOur purpose\nOur internal purpose, \n‚We secure your future™\n, expresses our \nreason for being. It guides our decisions and actions across the \nAllianz Group based on three key principles: \nStability &amp; Security: Our solidity makes us a reliable partner for \nlong-term planning. Personal Growth\n: We empower our customers by giving them \nsound confidence to take risks. \nSocietal Impact\n: We take responsibility for more than our business \nand are active leaders in driving positive changes and shaping the \nworld for the better.\nGroup strategy\nTo live up to our purpose, we set ourselves three strategic objectives \nin 2018 under the motto ‚Simplicity wins™. We seek to:\nOutperform\n our competitors, both old and new, in terms of growth \nand profitability as well as customer and employee satisfaction˚ \nTransform\n our organization to become simple, digital and scalable˚ \nandRebalance\n our business towards large, profitable and fast-growing \ngeographies and business segments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated some trends that shape \ninsurance markets, while halting others. The altered environment \nhas reinforced many of our strategic priorities, for example of \nback-to-front digitalization, simplification and rebalancing of \nproduct portfolios. An update to the ‚Simplicity wins™ strategy will \nbe˜published in late 2021.\nThe Renewal Agenda is our implementation plan. We are making \ngood progress with our strategic and transformational initiatives \nthat position us to meet its targets and objectives:\nOutperform\n: We have moved to a system of monitoring, \nbenchmarking and incentives that is designed to make us the best \nin our respective markets. We use best-in-class benchmarking for \nshareholder value (e.g. return on equity), customer satisfaction (e.g. \nNet Promoter Score, NPS®), and employee engagement (e.g. IMIX to \nmeasure in how far our people are on board for our transformation \njourney). We continue to strive towards leadership and shaping the \nglobal sustainability agenda (see also section 02.1). \nTransform\n: The Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-to-end \nglobal business model that we use to transform Allianz insurance \nfrom the inside out. Through the ACM, we aim to offer simple easy-\nto-understand products, streamline and accelerate our processes \n(e.g. sales and claims) and move our operations onto a state-of-\nthe-art IT platform. The result will be happier customers, faster \ninnovation and real economies of scale. ACM is a proprietary, \nprinciple-based business model that simplifies and harmonizes \nour global business, transforming it from front-to-back, end-to-\nend, sales to products and claims to operations. By starting with \nthe customer and recognizing they don™t need complex insurance \nproducts with multiple variations, ACM breaks with the paradigm \nof˜designing insurance from the inside out.\nRebalance\n: We seek to maintain and consolidate our leading \npositions in core European markets while growing faster in the \nlargest and fastest-growing global markets for insurance and \nasset management. To serve the needs of our customers, we \nare rebalancing our product and services offerings, for example \ntowards health and protection, and our investments Œ including \ntowards alternative assets.\nTo deliver on our strategic objectives, we set clear \nannual˜targets:\n2021  target \n2020 results\n2019 results \nPerformance \n targets \nEarnings \n per Share \n(EPS)Compound \n Annual Growth \nRate (CAGR) \n2019Œ21 5 %16.48 •18.90 •Return \non Equity\n1&gt; 13 %11.4 %13.6 %Health  targets\nNet  Promoter\n Score\n&gt; 75 % of our entities above market\n79 %70 %Inclusive Meritocracy \nIndex (IMIX)\n&gt; 73 %78 %73 %1  \nRepresents the ratio of net income attributable to shareholders to the average shareholders™ \nequity at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period.

Today, they greatly in˝uence how we \nrun our business. In 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 \nand high pro˛le climate discussions further \nescalated the importance of sustainability. Our clear \nsustainability strategy and approach enables us to \nunderstand the risks and opportunities and mobilize \nour organization and global businesses in response.\nOur sustainability strategy shapes the way we run our business \ntogether with our roughly 150,000 employees, and how we manage \nour portfolios, while influencing the wider industry to create real \nworld impact in the economy and for society. \nWe want to be a leader and role model for integrating sustainable \nbusiness strategy and developing positive impact, especially in pursuit \nof a net-zero carbon economy. As a leading financial services company, \nwe ground our strategy in proactive risk management, detecting and \naddressing risks across our businesses. Through purposeful integration, \nour strategy builds on the proper management of sustainability-related \nrisks and ensures we capture the positive impacts and opportunities. \nIn 2020, we continued to strengthen our global sustainability approach \nand evolved our strategy in light of our group-wide purpose \n‚We secure \nyour future™\n. We took insights from the results of our 2019 materiality \nassessment and global megatrends such as COVID-19 and sustainable \nfinance regulation.\n  \nSee Sustainability Report 2019, section 02.5.\nTo aid delivery of our strategy, we established a central Global \nSustainability team as of 01 January 2021 (previously Corporate \nResponsibility team Œ see section 02.7.2). It is responsible for group-\nwide integration of sustainability and aligning the sustainability \nactivities of our local operating entities. We also announced that we \nwill establish a Sustainability Committee under the Supervisory Board \nin 2021, reflecting the core importance of sustainability at Allianz.\nOur sustainability strategy\nOur 2025 ambition is to move Allianz from being a leading company \nin its own right to being a sustainability shaper of our industry and \nbeyond. This is closely linked to our purpose, ‚We˜secure your future™. \nWe will deliver our ambition by fully integrating environmental \n(E), social (S) and governance (G) aspects into how we run our \norganization and business segments Œ Asset Management, P&amp;C \ninsurance, L&amp;H˜insurance and Proprietary Investments. \nE: Low-carbon Economy climate change and decarbonization\nWe will rigorously pursue decarbonization and net zero emissions \nat least in line with science-based targets. We do this for our own \norganization through greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions targets. \nWe˜do it through our businesses using our roles as an insurer, \ninvestor and asset manager to help manage the risks arising \nfrom climate change and to promote the low-carbon economy. \nThroughout 2020, we worked on setting a CO\n2 reduction target for \na subset of our investment portfolio. This target was announced in \nearly 2021. We continue to broaden our impact through engaging \nin alliances with the public and private sectors. \nS: Societal impact\nWe will use our roles as an employer, insurer, investor, and corporate \ncitizen to contribute to more inclusive and stronger societies. \nAs˜an employer, we thank our employees for continuing to serve \nour clients during the COVID-19 crisis Œ including during national \nlockdown periods and while working from home. We passed this \ntest with improved customer satisfaction (NPS) and improved \nemployee satisfaction (IMIX) scores (see sections 04.4 and 04.1). \nWe˜deliver our societal impact on next generations through Allianz™s \nCorporate Citizenship strategy which promotes social inclusion of \nchildren and young people worldwide (see section 02.3).\nG: ESG Governance\nWe will continue to integrate top class principles in how we run \nour organization and how we conduct our business, shaping \nsustainability regulations and reporting frameworks through \nexternal contributions and commitments. We believe in increased \ntransparency on sustainability matters and, at the start of 2021, \nwe˜committed to use the World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder \nCapitalism Metrics (see sections 02.7 and 06.3). Managing material \nESG risks and seizing opportunities is fundamental to our strategy \nwhile at the same time embedding compliance, responsible sales, \ntransparency, data protection and privacy across our operations. \nThe Allianz ESG approach ensures ESG integration in all insurance \nbusiness and investments of proprietary assets (see section 02.4).\nﬁ We are moving into a new phase of sustainability management where impact is front and center. \nThis means setting and delivering on ambitious commitments, such as our net-zero commitment, \nand playing a leading role in global partnerships to develop solutions, such as the U.N. convened \nGlobal Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance and Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance.ﬂ\nLine HestvikChief Sustainability Officer\n Allianz SE\n10\n02.2\n Climate change and decarbonization\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n02.1 Our global sustainability approach\n02.2 Climate change and decarbonization\n02.3 Creating societal impact\n02.4 ESG business integration\n02.5 Materiality02.6 Stakeholder engagement02.7 Our sustainability governance\n Governance\n Sustainability management Transparent reporting\n Sustainability ratings and performance\n02.8 Our commitment to human rights\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nLimiting and adapting to climate change is a challenge that requires the collective e˚orts of \ngovernments, businesses, industries and communities \naround the world.

As asset owners, we are uniquely positioned \nto shape the global economy and financial systems. We can \ndrive the development of industry best practices through \nour investments by decarbonizing investment portfolios and \nsupporting GHG emission reductions in the real economy. \nAllianz is a founding member of the U.N.-Convened Net-Zero \nAsset Owner Alliance (AOA). Launched in 2019, it is mobilizing the \nworld™s largest asset owners Œ such as pension funds, insurers and \nsovereign wealth funds Œ to bring investment portfolios to net-zero \nby 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C \nabove pre-industrial temperatures. \nBy the end of 2020, the Alliance had grown to include 33 asset \nowners from around the globe, representing assets under \nmanagement of over 5 trillion U.S. dollars. New members that \njoined during the year include the insurance companies Generali, \nQBE and Munich Re, the German sovereign wealth fund KENFO, \nor˜the U.S.-based pension funds of Wespath and the U.N. Joint Staff.\nMembers are committed to set intermediary decarbonization \ntargets every five years for their portfolios. All members\n1 have now carried out and disclosed portfolio baseline assessments \nand have defined an intermediary five-year target for 2025. They \nwill now work together to define best practice to reduce GHG \nemissions in their portfolios.\nTo achieve meaningful impact, members™ portfolio transition to \nnet-zero should lead to emission reductions in the real economy. \nThey are engaging with portfolio companies and asset managers, \ndirectly and through concerted sector roundtables, and with \ngovernments and public policies to finance the transition. \nIn 2020, the Alliance published a position paper on how the \nCOVID-19 recovery can be used to get back on track with climate \ngoals and accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon economy\n Read the full paper here.\nThe Alliance will report publicly on progress against targets with \nthe first joint report to be published by December 2023.\nﬁ Climate change is the de˚ning risk of the \n21st century, set to impact societies and \neconomies, and therefore investment \nportfolios and business models.

Our commitment to \ntackling environmental, social and governance (ESG) \ntopics looks to embed sustainability everywhere \nŒ in the actions and decisions impacting our own \noperations as well as our insurance, investment and \nasset management activities. We manage ESG considerations diligently across our businesses \nto manage ESG risks and capture ESG opportunities. It drives us to \ncreate sustainable products and services, collaborate with clients \nand investees to deliver real-world benefits, and direct capital flows \ntowards sustainable outcomes. \nOur industry-leading approach integrates ESG concerns by \napplying group-wide corporate rules and ESG processes across \nall relevant underwriting, investment, asset management and \noperations activities. This means continuously increasing and \nstrengthening the collaboration between the relevant functions \n and business areas across Allianz Group.\nThrough the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk \nManagement and other corporate rules such as the Allianz \nStandards for P&amp;C Underwriting and Allianz ESG Functional \n Rule for Investments, ESG considerations are embedded across \nthe˜business. The publicly available Allianz ESG Integration \nFramework further increases transparency around internal ESG-\nrelated processes and guidelines.\nESG integration is not only about managing risks from ESG topics Œ \nwe also see clear opportunities \nfor offering sustainable \nproducts and services that \ncreate added value. \n  \nFind out more on our sustainable \nsolutions approach˜in˜section 03.4.\n  \nRead more on the ESG \nIntegration Framework here.\nRegulation as a driver of ESG\nWe believe a certain level of regulation is necessary to drive \nintegration of ESG considerations in business activities and we \nactively engage in their development. We are focused on a \nnumber of workstreams to address new regulatory and supervisory \nrequirements Œ see Regulatory and Public Affairs (section 04.3).\nEmbedding ESG in insurance, proprietary investments \nand operations\nConsistent application of ESG processes in insurance and \nproprietary investment activities is crucial to mitigate the risks and \ncapture the opportunities arising from ESG trends.\nESG referral process, sensitive business guidelines \nand sensitive countries\nWe integrate ESG processes for P&amp;C insurance, including ESG \nscreening, referrals and assessments for sensitive business areas, \nthrough the Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management \nand group-wide underwriting standards. Similar processes are \napplied in other parts of the insurance business and operations \nsuch as procurement. Our internal audit functions and underwriting \nintegrity and governance teams regularly review these \nESG processes. \nWe also apply this ESG referral and assessment process and \nguidelines for unlisted proprietary investments. Furthermore, \nfor procurement activities, a negative answer to ESG screening \nquestions in the vendor integrity screening triggers an \nESG assessment. \nEvery transaction is screened by the respective operating entity to identify \npotential ESG concerns. If a risk is identified, the case is referred to the \nappropriate group-level ESG function for a more detailed assessment. \nIn 2020, group-level ESG functions conducted 597 assessments \nbased on the ESG referral and assessment process and guidelines \n(2019: 602 assessments). 60.5 percent of cases were approved and \n31.8 percent were approved subject to certain mitigation measures \nor conditions. 7.7 percent were declined or not pursued (for details \nsee ˜Tables ESG-1 to 3).\nWhat is ESG and why it is important?\nESG refers to the non-financial risks and opportunities, which \ncan be influenced by, and/or can influence, Allianz™s business \nactivities and operations. In the Allianz Group Risk Policy, we \ndefine ESG risks as events or conditions which, if they occur, could \nhave significant negative impacts on the assets, profitability or \nreputation of Allianz Group or one of its companies. Examples \ninclude environmental and climate change risks, human rights \nviolations, risks to local communities and workforce risks. \nIf they are not identified and managed effectively, ESG risks \ncan have significant repercussions for Allianz, its customers, \nits suppliers, and invested companies. These span legal and \nreputational risks, supply chain and business disruption risks, \nquality and operational risks, and financial risks.\nESG factors can also represent business opportunities, such \nas insuring and investing in renewable energy or affordable \nhousing to supporting the energy transition through insurance.\nESG referral and assessment process\n number of assessments by category\n˜˚˛˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˛ˇ˜˝˙ˆˇ˘ˆ˛ˆˆ˘˝˘˘˜˜˚˜˜˚˛˝˜˚˛˙˜˚˜˚Insurance\nInvestments\nProcurement\nOther14\n02.4 ESG business integration\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n02.1 Our global sustainability approach\n02.2 Climate change and decarbonization\n02.3 Creating societal impact\n02.4 ESG business integration\n02.5 Materiality02.6 Stakeholder engagement02.7 Our sustainability governance\n Governance\n Sustainability management Transparent reporting\n Sustainability ratings and performance\n02.8 Our commitment to human rights\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nESG scoring and engagement approach\nFor ESG integration in listed proprietary assets, established \nprocesses such as the ESG scoring approach are designed to \nmanage ESG risks and opportunities in Allianz™s portfolio. \nOther tools that help integrate ESG into business processes include: \nŁ ESG exclusions such as coal-based business models and \ncontroversial weapons\n1˚Ł Integration of ESG criteria in asset manager selection and monitoring˚ \nŁ Sustainability-themed investments such as renewable energy, \ngreen real estate, and green bonds˚ and \nŁ Regular dialogue and exchange with our insurance clients, \ninvestee companies, asset managers.\n  \nSee the Allianz ESG Integration Framework for additional details on all ESG \nintegration processes at Allianz Group. \n  \nSee sections 03.1 and 03.2 for additional details on these processes for \ninsurance activities and our proprietary investments.\nESG in asset managementOur asset managers, AllianzGI and PIMCO, continue to expand \ntheir ESG capabilities and product offerings.

Similar trends have been observed in other markets. \n3 Environment\n   Ł COVID-19 radically changed the way we work (see section 04.1 Human resources) and interact with our customers. These changes impact on our environmental footprint as an organization.\n4 Employees and \nworkplace\n  Ł COVID-19 accelerated the transition to the New Work Model. Among other initiatives, this resulted in the development of˜global remote working guidelines for office, remote and hybrid-virtual workers \n(working remotely approximately half of the time, see section 04.1 Human resources). \nŁ Topics like well-being, safety and mental health, teleworking and work-life balance have become priorities and these are˜referenced throughout this report.\nŁ Diversity and inclusion has become even more relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted minority groups such as women, LGBT+ employees and people of color.\n5 Human rights  Ł Human rights matters remain high on the agenda of NGOs and increasingly appear on the agenda of legislative and regulatory bodies (see sections 02.8 Our commitment to human rights and \n04.8˜Sustainable procurement). \nŁ At the German and E.U.-level, human rights due diligence legislation is being discussed. France has already passed due diligence requirements. The U.K. is working on tightening its Modern Slavery Act \nand˜Australia has passed similar legislation.\n6 Social/financial \ninclusion  Ł Potential impacts related to growing rates of unemployment worldwide make our contribution to addressing inequalities all the more important (see section 02.3 Creating societal impact).\n1 Integrating ESG in insurance and investments, sustainable insurance and asset management products, sustainable and responsible investing.\nThe following table outlines the strategic material topics identified \nthrough our 2019 assessment.

This will have a long-term impact on being better prepared for natural disasters \n(see section 03.1.3 Natural catastrophes).\n9 Data privacy\n Ł Digital customer interactions require increased focus on data privacy. Many of our interactions have become more virtual Œ both between colleagues and with our clients.\nŁ Managing our customers™ privacy has become even more important as interactions move into the digital sphere. Managing with our customers™ data in an ethical way has also increased in importance \n(see˜section 04.2.1 Data protection and privacy). \n10 Social and political\n unrest\n Ł The global pandemic has changed the geopolitical situation in many countries driven by political tensions and instability or internal conflicts. This is an ongoing situation that societies will need to navigate.\n11 Ethics Ł Business ethics and responsible conduct continue to be important topics in terms of transparency, compliance, risk˜management and reputation (see section 04.5 Compliance).\n12 Cyber risks\n Ł COVID-19 has further increased the impact of cyber incidents and attacks as more activities move online (see section 03.1.4 Cyber security).\n13 Safety risks\n Ł Customer safety and product safety and quality remain top priorities for Allianz. Safety risk is directly related to business interruption, which has been highly impacted by COVID-19.\n14 Customer satisfaction\n Ł As a financial service provider, we continue to digitalize our customer interactions (see section 04.4 Customer satisfaction). \nŁ Social distancing measures have required the enabling of customer facing staff to continue to provide excellent customer service through online channels. \n15 Animal welfare \nstandards\nŁ This issue continues to be important with the relationship between animal welfare around the world and future pandemic risk a topic of debate.\n16 Health Ł The topic of health, including physical health and mental health, increased in importance for stakeholders such as employees and customers due to the pandemic (see section 04.1 Human resources \nand˜the˜Group Annual Report 2020, Non-Financial Report, Employee matters).\nŁ Access to healthcare and health system stability have risen up as topics of importance and will likely continue to increase in importance. \n17 Demographic change\nŁ This continues to be a long term underlying issue.\n18 Charitable and community˛support\nŁ Charitable work and community support became even more important during the pandemic. \nŁ In some instances, charity programs have needed to be adjusted in response to both pandemic-related disruption and˜changing societal needs (see section 04.9 Societal impact). \nOur material topics \nHigh materiality     to Medium materiality 17\nWe engage with investors to communicate our sustainability strategy \nand performance, enabling them to make informed decisions about their \ninvestments and for our businesses to understand their expectations.\nŁ Annual General Meeting\nŁ Dialogs and roadshows\nŁ Ratings and benchmarks\nŁ Website, Sustainability Report, rating results \n e.g. DJSI\nInvestors\nFeedback from customers helps us improve our products, services and \nprocesses and offer easy and adaptable solutions.\nCustomers sŁ Customer surveys and dialogs\nŁ Learning from and sharing customer insights\nŁ Review of financial services sector developments\nŁ Research and development to support \nproduct innovations\nŁ Net Promoter Score (NPS)\nŁ Allianz Risk Barometer Survey\nGiven the pace and scale of global change, we must work together with \nbusinesses, governments and institutions to identify sustainable solutions and drive positive change.\nSociety\nŁ Partnerships for civic engagement\nŁ Thought leadership on global issues\nŁ Panel discussions and roundtables\nŁ Foundations, donations and volunteering\nŁ Press events, journalist surveys and roundtables\nŁ Formal dialogs with NGOs and ESG professionals\nEmployees who are engaged with and committed to their jobs generate \nlong-term value for businesses.

We proactively tackle \nhuman rights issues that could be impacted by our \nbusiness and this is an expectation that is re˝ected \nby˜expanding legislation. \nBusiness impacts on human rights can occur in many ways, \nincluding, but not limited to: employee rights and worker safety˚ \nuse of forced or child labor˚ discrimination˚ environmental impacts˚ \nconsumption of natural resources˚ controversial weapons˚ and \nimpacts on local communities.\nThe U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide \na framework for responsible business operations and activities. \nWe˜are committed to respecting these standards and we have \nbeen a participant in the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) Œ which, \nthrough its ten principles, covers human rights, labor standards, \nenvironmental protection and anti-corruption, since 2002. \nWe˜annually communicate our progress on these principles.\n  \nRead our UNGC Communication on Progress.\nIn the German context, Allianz adheres to the National Action Plan \nfor Business and Human Rights which is based on the U.N. Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights. To manage our human \nrights impacts, we must look across each of our roles as an insurer \nand investor, as an employer, as a company including our supply \nchain, and as a corporate citizen. For each of these roles, we have \nembedded different processes to manage human rights risks and \nact on opportunities to drive positive change.\nIntegrating human rights into our core business\nAs a corporate insurer and investor, our human rights due diligence \nprocess forms part of our overall ESG approach which is integrated \ninto our broader risk management system (see section 02.6). We˜use \na combination of sector and country-specific approaches to identify \nhuman rights risks. Human rights related due diligence has been \nintegrated into all 12 sensitive business areas where relevant, \nto˜ensure that human rights is a part of the overall risk assessment \nfor insurance and investments in non-listed asset classes. We also \nmaintain a mandatory referral list for sensitive countries where \nsystematic human rights violations occur. For business transactions \nlocated in these countries, we do explicit due diligence in accordance \nwith our human rights guideline that covers various human \nrights violations. \nIn 2020, 32 ESG referrals were assessed under the Human Rights \nguideline. Additional details on these human rights assessments can be found in \n˜Table ESG-3.\nIn terms of investor engagement, if we identify an issuer in our listed \ninvestment portfolio that is flagged for human rights issues by our \nexternal ESG data provider, we prioritize this issuer for a systematic \nengagement (see more in section 03.2).\nAllianz aims to identify, prevent or mitigate adverse human \nrights impacts linked to our business activities and operations, \nincluding our supply chain. \nWe are committed to respecting human rights in line with the U.N. \nGuiding Principles for Human Rights and as set out in the Labor \nStandards of the International Labor Organization (ILO).\nRespecting human rights as an employer\nAs an employer, we apply the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights throughout our worldwide operations. We have integrated \nthe 10 principles of the UNGC into our globally binding Code \nof Conduct. We also respect the Organization for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for \nMultinational Enterprises. We endorse the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and \nRights at Work, including the ILO declaration on the freedom \nof˜association and the right to collective bargaining. In countries \nwhere local law prohibits formalized unions and works councils, \nwe respect local law but do not obstruct parallel means of \nassociation and bargaining, and we strive to act in the spirit \nof˜the˜UNGC principles.Our commitment to foster workplace and gender equality goes to \nthe˜core of our approach as an employer. In 2020, Allianz™s CEO Oliver \nBäte signed a pledge to support the U.N. Women™s Empowerment \nPrinciples. This was followed in October by Allianz signing the B Team™s \nPrinciples for Equality which aim to ensure equitable, safe and dignified \nworkplaces that respect human rights and allow people to thrive. \n  \nFor more details on employee rights, gender equality and diversity initiatives, \nsee section 04.1.24\n02.8 Our commitment to human rights\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n02.1 Our global sustainability approach\n02.2 Climate change and decarbonization\n02.3 Creating societal impact\n02.4 ESG business integration\n02.5 Materiality02.6 Stakeholder engagement02.7 Our sustainability governance\n Governance\n Sustainability management Transparent reporting\n Sustainability ratings and performance\n02.8 Our commitment to human rights\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nRespecting human rights in our operations\nHuman rights due diligence in our operations is also part of our \nESG referral and assessment process. For procurement activities, \na˜negative answer to ESG screening questions in the vendor \nintegrity screening triggers an ESG assessment at Group level. \nWe extend our commitment to international human rights \nstandards to the workforce of our suppliers and those impacted \nby our supply chain. Our Global Sourcing and Procurement \ndepartment works with current and potential suppliers to ensure \nthey abide by the ESG standards outlined in the Allianz Code of \nConduct which align with ILO standards and the principles of the \nUNGC. Allianz is also committed to compliance with the Modern \nSlavery Act in the U.K., both from the perspective of our U.K. \nbusiness and the interactions of our wider Group. No issues were \nraised in regard to human rights issues in accordance with the \nModern Slavery Act in 2020. \n  \nRead the Allianz Group Statement on Modern Slavery. \n  \nRead the Allianz Group Code of Conduct.\nIntegrating human rights into our corporate \ncitizenship activities\nRespect for human rights is also a core principle of our corporate \ncitizenship activities, especially around the rights of children and \nyouth (see section 04.9). Our international network of 12 Allianz-affiliated corporate \nfoundations aim to help tackle societal challenges to safeguard \nthe˜future for the next generations. This network includes the \nAllianz˜Environmental Foundation, which is dedicated to responsible \nenvironmental management, and the Allianz Cultural Foundation, \nwhich works to promote intercultural dialogue and cooperation \namong young people.\nWhen Allianz donates to or partners with charitable organizations, \nrecipients must uphold our human rights standards. The Internal \nAllianz Guidance for Charitable Donations and Memberships \n(Corporate Giving) stipulates that corporate giving can only be \nmade to organizations that meet the principles set out in the \nAllianz˜Group Code of Conduct.\nLooking ahead\nOver the coming year, we will continue to apply ESG Sector Guidelines \nand Human Rights Guidelines for sensitive countries across all business \nlines and core processes dealing with insurance, investment and \nprocurement decisions. \nWe aim to further strengthen our approach to human rights \nintegration in our core business and organization.

We add value \nthrough dialogue with our stakeholders and by sharing \nour expertise to improve overall risk awareness and \nmitigation in˜the˜insurance˜sector.\n03.1.1 Integrating ESG in insurance\nEmbedding ESG considerations into our insurance business means \nwe are better placed to manage risks and opportunities to support \nsustainable development. Our risk exposure is mostly indirect through \nthe risks Allianz carries for its insured clients. We embed a strong ESG \nrisk management approach throughout our underwriting processes \nto manage exposure to such risks.\nOur ESG referral and assessment process ensures risks are identified, \nassessed and managed (see section 02.4). The process is integrated \ninto our overarching risk management framework that is applied to \nall insurance business globally, whether we are the lead insurer or \nacting as part of a panel. \nWhen our insurance underwriters identify an ESG risk, they refer the \ncase for assessment to Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty (AGCS) \nESG Business Services and/or Global Sustainability at Allianz SE. \nOur experts conduct in-depth assessments on a broad range \nof ESG risks including but not limited to environmental impacts, \nhuman rights violations (see section 02.4), and poor health and \nsafety performance. Based on the outcome of these assessments, \nthey decide whether a transaction may proceed with or without \nconditions. Conditions may include monitoring the project/client \nor engaging in a risk dialogue. If severe, systemic, and unmitigable \nESG issues are identified, the transaction may be declined.\nIn 2020, 430 insurance transactions were assessed for ESG risks, \na˜slight decrease compared to 2019 (474 transactions). This˜decline \nfrom 2019 is in line with our public commitments on coal-based \nbusiness models and a more stringent approach to our risk \nappetite, resulting in a lower number of transactions in these \nbusiness areas, which had previously been referred. See \n Tables\n ESG-1 to ESG-3 for additional details.\nESG risks can be dynamic and complex. Being responsible for a large \nunderwriting portfolio requires significant resources to continuously \nscreen and assess risks and engage clients and brokers in risk \ndialogues. In 2020, we launched an updated training module to \nsupport our underwriters in understanding and identifying ESG risks.\nIn the first half of 2020, Group Audit and several operating entity \naudit functions conducted an internal audit program to review the \nstatus of˜ESG integration across several large operating entities, \nincluding Allianz SE. The audit recommendations have been used \nto improve the approach for dealing with ESG risks across our (re)\ninsurance business locally and at Group level. \nIn late 2020, we kicked off a Group-wide project including Global \nSustainability, AGCS ESG Business Services, global and local \nunderwriting functions to develop the next level of ESG integration \nprocesses. The project takes into consideration the ESG Underwriting \nGuidance co-developed with the United Nations Environment Program \nFinance Initiative (UNEP FI) Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI).\n  \nFurther information about the Allianz ESG approach and processes \nrelating to our insurance business can be found in the Allianz ESG \nIntegration Framework.\nCommitment to the UNEP FI Principles for \nSustainable Insurance (PSI)\nWe are a signatory of the UNEP FI PSI and we submit an annual \nDisclosure on Progress. \nAs part of a PSI-convened group with 21 other insurance industry \ncompanies, we have been working on an insurance industry approach \nto implement the TCFD requirements. Together, we published the \nfirst guidance on how to analyze the impact of climate scenarios \nfor different types of insurance products (e.g. personal, Property-\nCasualty, Life/Health, reinsurance, etc.). \n Read the new guidance is available here.\nAdding value through research and engagement\nTo maximize our influence and scale our positive impact, we apply \nour ESG expertise to our own risk management and underwriting \ndue diligence and to that of our clients, brokers and business \npartners. Our consulting services enable clients to identify and \nassess their material ESG risks. We conduct in-depth research to stay ahead of emerging issues, \nto inform and develop our approach to risk identification and \nmanagement. This includes conducting research to understand the \nrelevance of ESG factors on claims and underwriting profitability. \nOur˜research shows that this extra-financial information provides \nsignals that are relevant for our underwriting decisions. For example, \nin 2020 we initiated a pilot for Director &amp; Officers (D&amp;O) insurance. \nFrom the end of the year, underwriting due diligence will be \nenhanced with an ESG D&amp;O Risk Score and other significant ESG \nKPIs˜that highlight and predict the risk for increased claims.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by leading industry-wide collaboration on ESG \nAs part of our collaboration with the PSI, we co-led a project \nto publish the first global guide and industry standard on \nintegrating ESG risks into insurance underwriting. The aim \nwas to highlight the benefits of integrating ESG into insurance \nbusiness models. We engaged with insurers, reinsurers, brokers, \nacademics and regulators to identify the ESG risks that are \nmost material to different insurance lines. \nPublished in June 2020, the guide shows how insurers can develop \na systematic approach to managing ESG risks in underwriting \nsuch as climate change, environmental \ndegradation, protected sites and \nspecies, animal welfare, human rights, \ncontroversial weapons and corruption. It \nincludes heat maps indicating the level of \npotential ESG risk across different lines of \nbusiness and economic sectors ranging \nfrom agriculture, chemicals, energy and \nhealthcare to infrastructure, mining \nand utilities.  \nRead the ESG guide on the UNEP FI \nPSI website.\n27\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n   Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n03.1.2 Climate and renewables\nThrough our insurance business, we anticipate risks and protect \nand care for people vulnerable to climate change. We˜support \nthe transition to a low-carbon economy through our insurance \nsolutions and expertise.\nThe Paris Climate Agreement emphasizes the role of insurance in \nmanaging the impacts of climate change. Our Climate Change \nStrategy (see section 02.2) is focused on providing insurance \nsolutions that help customers respond to a changing climate and \nfacilitate the development of the low-carbon economy. \nWith extreme weather events such as floods, storms, heatwaves \nand droughts becoming more common and intense, we research \nthe actual and future impacts of climate change to provide the best \npossible risk advice to society and customers. For example, we are \nworking on climate risk scores that could inform the development \nof˜prevention and risk transfer solutions.\nIncreasing resilience to climate risks\nClimate change has already started to modify the environment \nand will increasingly impact forests, crops and other commodities, \nproperty and infrastructure. Allianz helps shelter society from climate \nimpacts by incentivizing prevention and indemnifying losses from \nextreme weather events. \nWith our experience as a micro insurer and reinsurer of agriculture, \nwe bring innovative climate risk insurance to vulnerable regions \nŒ including weather index insurance, yield loss and animal \nmortality cover.\nOther examples include risk consulting services offered by \nAGCS and our work with the German Agency for International \nCooperation (GIZ) to enhance resilience of the capital of Ghana \nto˜flood-related disruptions (see case study).\nClosing the insurance gap\nIncreasing resilience against risks for the most vulnerable is a core \nelement of our Corporate Citizenship approach (see section 04.9). \nIn developing countries, the proportion of assets protected by \ninsurance is extremely low Œ with only 2-3 percent of losses from \nextreme events insured. \nWe actively support the InsuResilience Global Partnership (IGP)™s \ngoal to provide climate risk insurance for up to 500 million people in \nthe most vulnerable developing countries by 2025. Delphine˜Maidou, \nAllianz Africa Chief Operating Office, represents Allianz as˜one of two \nprivate sector representatives on the IGP™s High-Level Consultative \nGroup, which sets the framework for these initiatives. An outcome \nin 2020 was a declaration on gender, recognizing the importance \nof integrating gender-responsiveness within the Climate and \nDisaster Risk Finance and Insurance Framework for delivering on \nthe˜Partnership™s vision.\n Read more about the IGP.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by supporting governments to insure \n communities against climate risks\nWe are working with partners through the Insurance \nDevelopment Forum (IDF) to provide insurance solutions that \nenable governments in countries vulnerable to climate change \nto better protect their populations against natural disasters. \nThis year, with support from the German government, the \nIDF scaled up the development of insurance solutions in 20 \nvulnerable countries under a Tripartite Agreement with the \nUNDP and the German government. Allianz is leading jointly \nwith Swiss Re on the development of innovative insurance \napproaches for Pakistan and Ghana. \n  \nFind out more about the IDF.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by closing the protection gap for the most \nvulnerable communities\nOur three-year strategic alliance with the GIZ is aimed at \n‚Closing the Protection Gap™ in Ghana and Morocco by \nfostering integrated disaster risk management approaches, \nincluding risk transfer, to manage flood-related risks. The \nproject started in January 2018 and has been extended to \nSeptember 2021 to account for COVID-19 related delays. \nIndex-based flood covers have been developed and pilot \nproducts discussed for municipal assets in Accra, Ghana, and \nan industrial park near Agadir, Morocco. The products will \nbe further refined and embedded in resilience activities to \nreduce risk exposure.

Coal-fired power plants are \nthe single biggest source of GHG emissions globally.\n1 In May 2018, we˜announced that we would no longer insure single-site/\nstandalone coal-fired power plants or mines whether in operation \nor being planned. We also committed to completely phase out \ncoal-based risks from P&amp;C insurance portfolios by 2040 at the \nlatest. As of 2023, Allianz will exclude companies from its P&amp;C \ninsurance portfolios, which fail to present a credible transition \nstrategy away from coal and breach defined criteria. \nSystematic engagement with major coal companies is an opportunity \nto support companies™ management of material risks related to \nclimate change and promote the transition away from coal. In 2020, \nwe continued with this engagement with more than 30 companies in \nline with the Allianz P&amp;C coal phase-out approach.\n  \nFor further information, please see our climate-related financial disclosures \nsection 05 and the Allianz statement on coal-based business models.\nInsuring the low-carbon economy\nThe renewable energy industry is constantly evolving with national \nclimate change strategies and policies, the Paris Climate Agreement \nand corporate initiatives like RE100 driving change at pace. \nMany markets are not yet ready to make the transition in terms \nof experience, financing, regulations and insurance. We aim to \nsupport and help drive progress by offering our insurance and risk \nconsultancy expertise. \nDemand for electricity and the potential for renewables to reduce \npollution and emissions in developing countries position them as an \nattractive growth market. Developments are increasingly driven by \nprivate investors and corporate clients who see clean energy as a \nvaluable investment. Our aim is to reach significant market share in \nemerging renewable energy markets, building on our experience of \ninsuring renewable energy in more than 60 countries. \nAs a global leader in insuring low-carbon technologies, we provide \nstandardized and tailor-made insurance products as part of \nour Sustainable Solutions (see section 03.4). We apply our deep \ntechnological expertise and understanding of the power and \nenergy industry to enable investment and actively support clients \nwith their renewable energy transition.\nBuilding and operating renewable energy plants involves \nmultiple stakeholders and complex risks at different stages for \ninvestors, construction companies, operators and manufacturers. \nOur˜products cover all stages of the project lifecycle Œ from \nplanning to decommissioning Œ to provide reassurance and help \nstimulate the renewable energy transition. Solutions include \nerection and construction all risk insurance, liability insurance, \nmarine insurance and technical advisory solutions. We also insure \nrenewable energy plants against financial losses from lower than \nexpected annual energy yields (e.g. due to lack of wind or sun).\nGoing beyond insurance in the renewable \nenergy˛industry\nOur goal is to make renewable energy projects bankable, \ninvestable and insurable, to support the low-carbon transition. \nThe˜renewable energy industry is fast moving and our risk advisors \nand renewable energy experts ensure that we and our customers \nstay abreast of the latest developments. \nMaintaining risks at acceptable levels is crucial to maintaining \nstrong insurance portfolios. Our risk advisory services are \nimportant for meeting customers™ demands and assuring a \nsound˜insurance portfolio. \nDuring the planning and delivery phases of a renewable energy \nproject, cost efficiency, accuracy and fast reaction to rapidly \nchanging conditions are important. Projects are often sold to \ninvestors at this stage˚ and quality assurance, the right cash flow \nmodels, and meeting tax and legal requirements is critical to a \nsuccessful process.\n1  Chapter 2 of IPCC™s Special Report on 1.5°C.\n29\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by bringing stakeholders together understand climate risk \nThe future impact of climate change will depend on the political \nwill to address the crisis and the speed at which it can be managed. \nIf ambitious mitigation is introduced swiftly enough, preventive \nmeasures can keep overall risk at an affordable level for the \ninsurance sector in developed insurance markets. \nIn regions that have high exposure to natural catastrophes, \nmore risk participation of the public sector and the insured \nmay˜be needed. This could be in the form of investment in \nhigher˜protection standards (such as flood defenses) or higher \nrisk˜retentions. Under more extreme warming scenarios, \ninsurability challenges may arise. This˜could burden the \nsector, especially in highly exposed regions such as low-lying \ncoastal areas.\nManaging this challenge requires constant and open dialogue to \nfoster understanding of the issues and better resilience to climate \nrisks. In October 2020, we held the first (virtual) annual Allianz \nUnderstanding Climate Risk Stakeholder Dialogue and Award.\nOver 250 stakeholders from Allianz and partner institutions came \ntogether to focus on building understanding of climate impacts, \nidentifying threats and opportunities, and charting a common path \nfor action through dialogue between academics, public sector \nand industry. \nThe winner of the annual Allianz Climate Risk Research Award \nfor young PhD students working on innovative approaches to \naddress climate risks was Lena Fuldauer, a doctoral researcher \nat˜the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. \nShe assesses extreme weather risks and studies their impact on \nthe 17 Sustainable Development Goals in countries like Curacao, \nSaint Lucia and currently in Ghana. She also provides training for \nstakeholders from ministries, private sector and academia on the \nuse of systems modelling tools to inform adaptation planning. \nHer˜work contributes to build the much-needed climate resilience \nfor a sustainable future.\n  \nFind out more about the Allianz Climate Risk Research Award online here.\nAllianz Climate Risk Research Award candidates\nWinnerLena Fuldauer\nPhD Researcher at the Environmental Change \nInstitute University of Oxford.\nResearch Title: Impacts of climate change \nhazards on sustainable development and \nnational adaptation responses.\nNadia Bloemendaal\nPhD Researcher Tropical Cyclone Risk Under \nClimate Change at the Vrije Universiteit \nAmsterdam, the Netherlands. \nResearch Title: The Perfect Storm˚ Improving \nthe estimation of the global distribution of \ntropical cyclone risk for present and future \nclimate scenarios across high spatial scales.\nAndrew Magee\nPostdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for \nWater, Climate and Land (CWCL), University \nof Newcastle, Australia. \nResearch Title: Tempestuous winds and \nvulnerable island nations: a new tropical \ncyclone outlook for the Southwest Pacific\nNivedita Sairam\nPostdoctoral Researcher at Helmholtz-Centre \nPotsdam Œ German Research Centre GFZ.\nResearch Title: Bayesian approaches for \nmodelling flood damage processes.\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n   Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n30\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n    \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n03.1.3 Natural catastrophes\nPredicting the˛unpredictable\nNatural catastrophes Œ including earthquakes, fires, floods and \nextreme storms Œ can devastate communities and the recovery \ncan take many months, or even years. Allianz is an expert in \ninsuring against these risks. We are constantly improving our \ntools to identify and manage risks for our customers and support \nthem when the worst happens.\nSocio-economic shifts, global interdependencies and climate \nchange all play a role in the changing extent of weather-related \ninsurance losses. According to the World Economic Forum™s (WEF) \nGlobal Risk Report 2021, two of the top five global risks are linked \nto environmental disaster and extreme weather and in the short-\nterm (0-2 years), extreme weather events rank third in the list of \ncritical risks threatening the world.\n1The associated losses have increased 15-fold in recent decades, \nimplying high risk and volatility for the insurance industry. The Allianz \nRisk Barometer 2021\n2 places natural catastrophes sixth in its ranking of \nglobal business risks, with economic losses totaling around 175 billion \nU.S. dollars in 2020\n3 up from 139 billion U.S. dollars in 2019.\nExperts at Allianz Reinsurance (Allianz Re) include meteorologists, \nhydrologists, geophysicists, geographers and mathematicians. \nTogether, they model around 50 natural catastrophe (Nat Cat) \nscenarios for the Group using data captured using best-in-class \nstandards. Applying their scientific understanding to the Allianz \nportfolio with its insured values, our experts assess overall Nat Cat \nrisk. Vendor and inhouse applications can provide a comprehensive \npicture of risk accumulation in any defined location. This is used as \nthe basis for effective risk management measures. It is also used to \nenhance risk-based pricing for Nat Cat perils and provide portfolio \nmanagers with insight into local and regional risk accumulations.\nAllianz Re is constantly improving Cat Risk Management at \nGroup and local levels. In 2020, we made important progress in \nestablishing the Catastrophe Target Architecture (CTA). It includes \nthe Allianz Modelling Platform (AMP), which will host all internally \ndeveloped Nat Cat risk models. Through a standardized framework \nand process automation, the platform enables us to leverage \nour catastrophe claims history and our view of risk, for example \nincorporating an estimation of potential climate change impacts. \nWe continue to enhance our geoinformation system (GIS) tools to \nprovide a profound understanding of the exact geolocation of a \ncustomer™s house or a company™s production site. For floods, a peril \nwhich is expected to worsen with climate change, the difference of \na few meters can have a big impact on the risk profile of a location. \nThe latest developments add vital capabilities to our applications, \nsuch as by enabling underwriters to access detailed risk scores by \nindividual Nat Cat peril for every location globally. \n1  WEF, Global Risks Report 2021.\n2  Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty, Allianz Risk Barometer 2021.\n3  Swiss Re Group, Swiss Re Institute estimates USD 83 billion global insured catastrophe losses in 2020, the fifth-costliest on record.\n31\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n   Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.1 Sustainability in insurance\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by supporting customers to manage cyber \nrisks˛during the pandemic\nIn the first half of 2020, widespread lockdown and home \nworking as a result of COVID-19 created new possibilities \nfor malicious acters to interrupt our customers™ business. \nAs˜highlighted by the E.U.™s cyber security network, COVID-19\n3 left many people vulnerable at a time when they are more \ndependent on living and working digitally than ever. \nTo support our customers, Allianz Risk Consulting \npublished guidance on ‚Staying cyber-secure during the \npandemic™ Œ available on our website. It includes measures \nto help employees better combat the cyber challenges \nCOVID-19 brings.\n1   WEF Global Risk Report 2020.\n2   McAfee Economic impact of Cybercrime.\n3   European Commission: The COVID-19 Hackers Mind-set.\n03.1.4 Cyber security\nSmart technologies have enormous potential to improve human \nlife and the health of the planet, but they have many unintended \nconsequences.\n1 We have more than a decade of experience in \ncyber insurance Œ protecting organizations against cybercrime \nand digital threats. We are evolving our solutions to enable more \ncustomers to manage the risks.According to the WEF, more than 50 percent of the global population \nis now online and some one million people join the internet every day. \nThe Allianz Risk Barometer 2020 ranks cyber incidents among the \ntop risks of doing business globally. Cyber-crime costs an estimated \n600 billion U.S. dollars a year.\n2 Criminals are becoming more \nsophisticated in their methods to steal data, commit fraud and extort \nmoney. At the same time, there is a growing cyber threat from nation \nstates and affiliated hacker groups targeting critical infrastructure or \nstealing valuable data or˜trade secrets from companies.\nCyber incidents are increasingly likely to spark litigation including \nsecurities and consumer class actions. Data breaches and IT \noutages can generate large third-party liabilities as affected \ncustomers or shareholders seek to recoup losses from companies.\nAdapting our new insurance approach to cyber risk \nAllianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty (AGCS) protects organizations \naround the world against cybercrime and digital threats. The types \nof risks it covers include first-party losses (e.g. business interruption, \nrestoration and crisis communications) and third-party losses (e.g. data \nbreaches, network interruption and notification expenses). \nMost traditional policies were designed when cyber had not \nyet emerged as a major risk and these policies do not explicitly \nmention or consider cyber risk. To remove coverage uncertainty \nfor customers, we are working to make it clear how cyber risks are \ncovered in traditional policies and for which scenarios a dedicated \ncyber insurance solution is needed.\nOver the past two years, we have reviewed cyber risks across P&amp;C \npolicies spanning commercial, corporate and specialty insurance \nsegments. We have developed a new underwriting strategy to \naddress cyber exposures and we are now in the process of ensuring \nrelevant policies are updated and clarified in regard to cyber risks. \n Read more about our new approach to insurance cyber risks on our website.\nSupporting our customers to manage cyber risks\nCyber insurance offers much more than just compensation for \npotential financial losses. It also includes valuable prevention and \nincident response services that enable companies to improve their \ncyber resilience and mitigate negative impacts after an incident. \nAGCS™s expert consultants also support customers to recover from \nan incident and to ensure proper disclosure of a privacy incident to \nregulatory bodies and customers. \nﬁ  \nRegulatory landscape uncertainties, \nrisks˜associated with remote working and \ncontinuous increase in ransomware attacks \nhave been de˚ning factors of the past year. \nWe continue to navigate this landscape \nusing new technology, analytics and \nstrategic partnerships with security vendors \nto build a stable book of business and swiftly \nassist our clients in a moment of crisis.ﬂ \nMarek Stanislawski\nGlobal Cyber Underwriting Lead\n Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty\n32\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n   Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n03.1.5 Emerging consumers\nIn 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed \nthe inequalities faced by people around the world. The emerging \nconsumers market, defined as lower-income populations in \nAfrica, Asia and Latin America, consists of half of the world™s \npopulation. Many of these people are severely underinsured. \nAllianz is committed to closing the protection gap and providing \naccess to affordable insurance solutions to support low-\nincome populations. \nOur purpose, ‚We secure your future™, includes providing emerging \nconsumers with affordable and effective insurance solutions. \nThis˜represents a significant sustainable growth opportunity for our \nbusiness Œ both financially and socially. Increasing resilience against \nprevalent risks in society for the most vulnerable is a key focus in our \nSocietal Impact approach (see section 04.9).\nCollaborating to scale our impact\nEmerging consumers are usually first-time buyers of formal \ninsurance products and often do not have a bank account. \n Non-traditional offerings, distribution models and payment \nchannels are needed to reach and service this target segment. \nProducts and processes need to be simple and relatable for people \nwho are not used to traditional financial services and distribution \nmodels need to be cost-efficient to maximize client value.\nDigitalization is unleashing new opportunities, with affordable \ninsurance and health services being increasingly delivered via \nmobile technology. This trend accelerated during the COVID-19 \npandemic. To make the most of the opportunities, we are \nexpanding our partnerships with companies that complement \nour core capabilities with digital technologies and go-to-market \napproaches, tailored to the requirements in the emerging \nconsumers business. \n1  \nTotal customer and revenue data includes figures from non-consolidated entities outside \nthe˜reporting boundaries (GRI 102-45).\n2 Restatement of 2019 data due to reclassification of emerging consumer products.\n3 Restatement of 2019 data due to changes in scope.\nReaching underinsured customers\nIn 2020, we served 46.1 million customers\n1 in the emerging \nconsumers segment (2019: 55.4 mn customers\n2). Revenues were at \n• 452.2 million3 (2019: • 413.9 mn) Œ equivalent to around • 9.80 in \nannual revenue per customer\n1 for this market. Allianz consolidated \nentities served 10.1 million customers and contributed revenues \nof • 56.1 million2.

It typically \ncovers the outstanding loan amount in the event of death of the loan-taker \nor˜a family member.\nFuneral Insurance\nWe offer funeral insurance, covering the funeral costs of the insured, to emerging \nconsumers in several countries, including Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. \nHealth insurance \nWe offer a variety of health insurance benefits, ranging from maternity and \naccident riders to comprehensive medical reimbursement covers for GOJEK \ndrivers in Indonesia. Hospital cash products pay out a daily lump sum to \nprotect customers against loss of income in the event of hospitalization. \nWe˜also offer telemedicine services with partners like BIMA and Halodoc, \ngiving emerging consumers access to doctors on the phone 24/7.\nCrop insurance \nIn India, we offer crop insurance to smallholder farmers to protect them \nfrom catastrophic weather events like droughts or floods. The insurance \nis˜bundled with loans taken by the farmers and pays out upon triggering \na˜pre\n-determined index (e.g. rainfall amount below a defined level).\n33\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n   Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.1 Sustainability in insurance\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by creating customer-centric solutions for \ncommunities in Indonesia\nUnderstanding where our customers live and what their habits \nare enables us to create solutions directly connected to their daily \nlives. The team from Allianz Indonesia developed two innovative \nconcepts using design thinking in local communities. One concept \nbridges the gap between an existing informal risk-sharing \nmechanism and formal insurance, and the other implies trading \nwaste for a personal accident cover.\nBoth initiatives together won the Insurance Asia Awards for the \n‚Insurance Initiative of the Year™ in 2020.\nTrading Waste for Protection \nCurrently, only seven percent of the 65 million tons of waste \nproduced in Indonesia every day is recycled.\n1 Many households \ncollect recyclable items and have them weighed at so-called \nwaste banks where the value of the waste is converted into \nsmall amounts of cash or mobile money Œ though usually too \nsmall to make a significant difference in people™s lives. Allianz \nIndonesia has partnered with the country-wide network of waste \nbanks to offer monthly personal accident insurance in return for \ncollected waste Œ thus offering value through protection benefits \nfor households.\nSecuring funeral funds for when they are needed\nNeighborhood communities often support residents with informal \nfuneral funds that covers funeral costs and condolence money if \na community member passes away. These funds are financed by \nhousehold contributions and often run the risk of being in deficit. \nAllianz Indonesia formalized this informal risk-sharing mechanism \nby offering a group term life insurance that prevents such funds \nfrom going into deficit and provides households with higher \namounts of condolence money.\nﬁ By joining Allianz I can be more \ncomfortable to organize the funeral \nservices when any of my family members \npasses away, such as having the burial \nservice and recitation for the departed \nsoul. It will also support family members \nif they plan to start a new business to \nsustain their family ˚nancially.ﬂ\nSiti Rochimah\nFuneral Fund Customer\n Allianz Indonesia\n Watch the video here.\nﬁ Why do I want to buy insurance from \nAllianz?

ESG integration \nis fundamental to our investment processes. Integration of \nESG in investments is steered by ESG teams globally, as well \nas other investment professionals across Allianz Group. Allianz \nInvestment Management (AIM) is the main group-wide investment \nmanagement function for proprietary assets. Furthermore, AIM also \nworks closely with the colleagues in Global Sustainability.\nWe have committed to the PRI, a U.N.-supported international \nnetwork of investors working together to promote the incorporation \nof ESG into investment decision-making.

We systematically integrate ESG considerations \nacross our entire investment portfolio\n2 and enhance and deepen \nour approach, which is comprised of the following elements:\n1. Asset manager selection, mandating and˜monitoringWe require all asset managers investing on our behalf to integrate \nESG considerations into the investment process (see \n Table\n ESG-7). \nAsset˜managers can fulfil this by being a PRI signatory or by \nhaving˜their own ESG policy. More than 99 percent of our assets are \nmanaged by asset managers that meet this requirement. From˜2020, \nwe take into consideration the PRI scores for asset managers, that are \nPRI signatories. We require a minimum score of a ‚B™. In case of a PRI \nscore of a ‚C™ or worse, AIM ESG team is informed. \nIn 2019, AIM started to systematically review the ESG approaches, \nincluding climate-related strategies, of its external asset managers. \nThese engagement dialogues focus on the governance structures \nof external asset managers to ensure clear responsibilities for \noverseeing ESG matters, monitoring methods for ESG risks, \nand˜opportunities and commitments to improving ESG practices \nin˜investee companies. This is an important step towards our goal \nto˜have a real-world impact. \nAs an asset owner, we are well-positioned to conduct ESG discussions \nwith our asset managers and this is an effective amplifier of our \nESG efforts. As a founding member of the U.N. convened Net-Zero \nAsset Owner Alliance, we want to ensure asset managers are well \nprepared to decarbonize their portfolios in line with a global average \ntemperature increase of not more than 1.5°C (see case study in \nsection 02.4).1  \nFigures based on economic view. Compared to accounting view it reflects a volume increase \ndue to switch from book to market values and changed asset scope (e.g. including For Valuation \nOnly (FVO), trading and real estate own-use).\n2  \nESG integration processes and coverage vary by asset class and between the type of portfolio \nand mandate. Minimum standards for ESG integration are in place for covering all investments \nthrough the Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments.\n2. Systematic integration of ESG factors Œ ESG referral\n and assessment process\nFor non-listed investments, such as real estate, infrastructure and \nprivate equity, we address ESG risks through a detailed referral \nprocess. We have published guidelines for ESG sensitive business \nareas (see section 02.4) and ESG screening is mandatory for all \ntransactions within these areas. \nDetection of an ESG risk triggers a referral process which leads to \na detailed assessment of the potential risk by Global Sustainability. \nBased on the outcome of the assessment, a decision is made \nwhether to proceed with a transaction, to proceed and require \nthe mitigation and management of ESG risks, or to decline a˜transaction on ESG grounds. \nIn 2020, 65 investment transactions were assessed (2019:˜64)\n (see ˜Tables\n ESG-1 to 3).3. Systematic integration of ESG factors Œ ESG˜scoring\nOur ESG scoring and engagement approach systematically \nidentifies and manages risks in our listed proprietary investment \nportfolio. We apply an ESG scoring process to all listed assets \nincluding sovereign bonds, corporate bonds and public equity. \nThe scoring process systematically assesses the ESG performance \nof individual issuers using ESG data provided by an external data \nprovider (MSCI ESG Research). This information is used to consider \nESG criteria in investment selection, leading to a more holistic \nsteering of our portfolio and targeted management of ESG risks \nand opportunities.\nWe have set a clear ESG performance threshold below which \ninvestments are deemed ‚ESG critical™. Investments in companies \nscoring below the threshold are continually monitored. An asset \nmanager with investments scoring below this threshold must ‚comply-\nor-explain™˚ meaning either reallocate to another issuer or explain \nand provide reasons for holding these issuers. The˜reasoning is \ndiscussed and assessed during regular ESG deep dive meetings \nwith˜asset managers.Our ESG scoring and engagement approach\nOur ESG scoring and engagement approach\n systematically \nidentifies and manages risks in our listed proprietary \ninvestment˜portfolio.\nSystematic \nengagementSetting \n the ESG \n threshold\nLong-term ESG \nperformance \nimprovements\nOperationalizing \n the scoring\nApplying ESG \nthreshold to \n portfolio\n36\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n4. Active Ownership Œ ESG engagement\nThe role of engagement as an effective and meaningful tool \nto address ESG concerns in investment portfolios has garnered \nwidespread acceptance in the investment community. For Allianz, \nengaging on ESG topics with our portfolio companies has become \nan expectation of our customers and stakeholders and it also makes \nclear business sense. When the companies we invest in emphasize \ncreating value for all stakeholders, they are better positioned to \ngenerate sustainable and long-term business success˜Œ and thus \nbetter results for our customers, whose premiums we invest. \nDuring three years of running our ESG engagement program as \nan asset owner, we have established a consistent approach to \naddressing ESG concerns and supporting sustainable programs \nat the companies we invest in. This remains the primary way we \naddress acute ESG issues, including human rights issues, in our \nportfolio companies. Our 2020 progress is described below under \n‚Bilateral Engagements™. \nAt the same time, the engagement community is evolving as \nthe need to magnify real world impact on systemic issues, \nsuch as climate change, places new emphasis on investor-led \ncollaborations. We have increased our efforts in the collaborative \nengagement community as one of the key ways we can amplify \nthe positive impact of our efforts. Progress in the area is described \nbelow under ‚Collaborative Engagements™.\nESG engagement approach highlights\n˜˜˚˛˝˝˙ˆ˙ˇ˜˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˜˚˛˝˛˝˙˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˜˜˚˛01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n    \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nEngagement overview\n number of engagements and outcomes\nEngagement on-going\nEngagement closed  with restrictions\nEngagement closed successfully\n˜˚˜˚˛˛˝˙ˆ˛˜˝˙ˆˆ˚ˆ˜˚˛˝˜˚˛˙˜˚˜˚37\nBilateral Engagements\nMeaningful change can take several years to achieve, and ongoing \nengagement is an impactful, mutually beneficial process. We could \nnot contribute to driving positive change if we automatically withdrew \ninvestments rather than engaging in dialog to address issues. That is \nwhy proactive engagement is integral to our ESG strategy. \nOur engagement team conducts in-depth research using \ninformation from MSCI ESG Research, other ESG data and \nintelligence providers, and the respective corporate disclosures \nor publications of each company. Wherever possible we involve \nAllianz colleagues that are based in the same country or region as \nthe company we are addressing Œ helping solidify our global and \ncollaborative approach. \nQuestions and requests related to identified ESG risks or \nopportunities and engagement objectives are submitted to the \ncompany for a written reply. Based on the company™s response, \nthe engagement team may conduct further engagement \nactivities Œ such as clarifying open points, requesting additional \ndisclosures, requesting written commitments in their reporting \nto address concerns, or conducting in-person (virtual) meetings \nwith management. \nEach engagement is monitored to track responsiveness by the \ncompany and progress against the identified ESG issues. If the \ncompany shows significant action to improve their ESG risk \nmanagement and/or to solve and prevent further ESG issues, \nthe engagement is closed as successful. Should a company™s \nanswers continually prove insufficient, show no willingness to \nimprove ESG performance, or fail to respond to our engagement \ncommunications, the engagement team recommends the restriction \nof all investments in the company. This recommendation is received \nand reviewed by the Chairperson of the Group ESG Board who \nsubsequently approves the restriction of the company from all \nproprietary portfolios. \n1  \nThis includes asset managers managing our assets, but are external to the Allianz Group of companies.\nIn 2020, we opened or continued direct engagement discussions \nwith 68 investee companies. Three of these engagements were \nconsidered successful and were closed, eight were closed without \nsuccess, and the remaining 57 are ongoing or continue to be \nmonitored. A comparison versus prior year can be found in \n˜Table˜ESG-11.\nIn addition to our own engagements as an asset owner, AllianzGI \nand PIMCO conduct ESG-specific engagements with investee \ncompanies that they invest in on our behalf as our asset managers. \nWe have also started working with external asset managers\n1 to ensure their ESG integration and engagement approach meets our \nexpectations and long-term investment goals. \nCollaborative engagements\nCollaborative engagements can take the form of multiple investors \naddressing a single company or addressing multiple companies \nand sectors at the same time. Collaboration consolidates the efforts \nfor the parties involved, allowing for more efficient and solution-\noriented discussions at a greater level of detail. When we seek \ncomplex operational changes in a company or sector, we find \ncollaborations are more effective than engaging alone. \nWe strive to be a key player in the engagement community and \nsupport the success of collaborative engagement initiatives. \nWe˜also support other asset owners and asset managers to \nbecome more actively involved in these dialogues. In 2020, we \nsignificantly increased our involvement in both the Investor Mining \nand Tailings Safety Initiative and the Climate Action 100+˜initiative. \nGoing forward, we will increase our collaborative engagement \nefforts, especially on climate change issues. This is necessary to \nmeet the targets we have publicly set for ourselves to decarbonize \nour portfolio in line with a maximum 1.5°C temperature rise without \ndivesting from high emitting sectors.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n –improving mining and tailings safety\nIn response to the tragic and catastrophic failure of a tailings \ndam facility in January 2019, the investment community came \ntogether to work with industry to ensure the root cause of \nthe failure was addressed and that such an event, if proper \nstandards are followed, will not occur again. \nThe initiative has established the first ever global standard \non tailing facility safety and created the open source Global \nTailings Portal, a centralized database of the world™s tailings \nfacilities. Allianz was a key participant and collaboratively \nengaged with companies in our portfolio to meet the \ndisclosure request from the initiative. \nThe initiative won the ‚PRI Stewardship Project of the Year \nAward™ and we continue to ensure the companies in our \nportfolio publicly report the information requested by \nthe standard. \n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n    \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n38\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n Climate Action 100+\nAllianz is an active member of Climate Action 100+ (CA100+). \nIts purpose is to engage with 167 of the world™s largest \ncorporate GHG emitters to set GHG emission reduction targets, \nstrengthen climate-related financial disclosures and improve \ngovernance on climate change.

SDGs \nrequires substantial financing in sectors such as health, \neducation, transportation and climate change. Close \ncollaboration of the private and public sectors in both \ndeveloping and developed countries will be key to achieving \nthe SDGs.\nIn October 2019, Secretary-General of the United Nations, \nAntonio Guterres, announced the Global Investors for \nSustainable Development (GISD) Alliance. Co-chaired by \nOliver Bate, CEO of Allianz SE, it aims to leverage finance and \ninvestment know-how to foster the 2030 Development Agenda.\nThe GISD Alliance develops solutions that foster scalable \ninvestment opportunities in developing countries including \nthe roll out and promotion of the use of innovative financing \nfacilities and tools.\nThis is strongly supported by the GISD Alliance™s focus on \nestablishing and strengthening partnerships between investors, \ngovernments and multilateral institutions.\nWithin the first year, the GISD Alliance has published a report \nwith 64 recommendations for policy makers to foster more \nprivate capital to the SDGs and has engaged with the European \nCommission on these. Additional deliverables include an \nagreed upon definition of sustainable development investing \nwhich is promoted to key stakeholders and a call to action to \nstrengthen the use of COVID-19 related bonds in the response \nto˜the pandemic.\nCurrent focus areas include the creation of investment vehicles \nand platforms, definition of sector specific SDG metrics and \nalignment of stakeholder interaction to long-term incentives \nincluding the SDGs.\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n    \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nIn line with these commitments, we have announced our first \nconcrete interim targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions \nin our proprietary investment portfolio fully in line with the Target-\nSetting Protocol (TSP) of the AOA, and aiming for the objective \nof achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

We actively pursue \ninvestment opportunities that support solutions to environmental \nand societal challenges such as climate change and infrastructure \ndevelopment. We are steadily increasing our sustainability-\nthemed investments and have grown to become a significant \ninvestor in renewable energy, green buildings and green bonds.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...funding innovative SMEs and start-ups in Africa\nIn Africa, it is mainly small companies that create the majority \nof jobs and support income security. On behalf of the German \nFederal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development \n(BMZ), KfW Development Bank and Allianz Global Investors \nhave set up a new fund of funds Œ AfricaGrow.\nThe project is an important component of Allianz™s Africa strategy. \nThe • 170 million fund of private equity funds blends public \nfinances and private investments from Allianz companies. It will \nfinance 150 innovative SMEs and start-ups in reform-oriented \nAfrican countries by 2030, promoting sustainable economic \nand social development and aiming for more than 25,000 new \njobs. Careful monitoring jointly conducted by DEG (Deutsche \nInvestitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) and AGI will ensure the \nfund has a measurable positive social and/or economic impact. \nIn 2020 the fund made its first two investments of • 30 million \nfocused on supporting early stage companies driving healthcare \nand education innovation in North Africa. \n Read more on the AfricaGrow website.\nWe have a growing global portfolio of climate solutions, investing \nin renewable energy, energy innovations as well as fostering the \ntransition to a net-zero economy. Examples include investments \nin the AllianzGI Renewable Energy Fund, the PIMCO Climate \nBond Fund and the Finance in Motion Green for Growth Fund, \nfinancing˜measures that reduce energy consumption, resource use, \nand GHG˜emissions.The listed fixed income investment portfolio shows a strong \ngrowth of green bonds in 2020. The overall growth in sustainability \nthemed investments reflect our commitment to transition Allianz™s \ninvestment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\nBeyond renewable energy, we finance industry innovations like \nclimate-smart fish production in the Sustainable Ocean Fund, \ncompanies and projects that contribute to ocean ecosystem health \nand initiatives that enhance the ability of oceans to sequester \ncarbon (thereby mitigating climate change). \nWe also seek investment opportunities in sustainable infrastructure \nin emerging economies. These markets face large financing \ngaps and our investments, alongside those of multilateral \ndevelopment banks and other partners, support sustainable \ndevelopment and economic growth. For example, Allianz finances \nAfrican infrastructure projects by investing into the Emerging \nAfrica Infrastructure Fund (EAIF). We are providing financing of \n•˜75 million and $ 25 million, both over 12 years, as EAIF™s first \ninsurance-investor.\nAt the end of 2020, investments in sustainability-themed assets \ntotaled • 39.3 billion (2019: • 29.5 bn) (see  Table ESG\n-8).Sustainability-themed investments\nInvestments by asset class\n  • bn\nGreen bonds\n˜˚˛˝˜˚˛˚˚˛˝˝˛˙˜˛ˆ˜˝˛˙ˆ˚˛ˆˆ˛˝ˇ˛˜˘˛˝˝˛˙˜˙˛˚˜ˆ˛˝˜˚˛˝˜˚˛˙˜˚˜˚Certified green buildings\nRenewable energy investments\nOther sustainable investments\n41\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n   ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.2.3 ESG in real estate investments\nThe real estate sector accounts for nearly 40 percent of global \nenergy-related CO˙ emissions.\n1 Real estate is also highly exposed \nto physical climate risks. Allianz Real Estate is working to \nreduce the GHG emissions of our portfolio to net-zero by 2050 \nby embedding ESG criteria and collaborating with others to \nstrengthen ESG activities.\nTo decarbonize the sector and comply with tightening \nenvironmental regulations, real estate assets face significant costs \nin meeting higher energy efficiency standards and addressing \ndemands from investors and tenants. Large-scale investment may \nbe required to improve resilience to climate change. At the same \ntime, changing investor and tenant preferences can provide new \nopportunities, for example by tapping into climate-conscious tenant \ngroups that increasingly demand green building certificates.\nAllianz Real Estate, our dedicated real estate investment and asset \nmanager, develops and executes tailored portfolios and investment \nstrategies for Allianz insurance companies and pension funds \naround the world, as well as for third-party clients with capabilities \nthat include direct and indirect investments and commercial \nreal estate loans. In 2020, Allianz Real Estate and other Allianz \noperating entities invest proprietary assets totaling • 18.3 billion \n(2019: • 14.6 bn) in certified green buildings around the world, \nincluding both equity and debt investments. \nAs a responsible investor and manager of one of the world™s largest \nreal estate portfolios, Allianz Real Estate strives to incorporate \nESG factors into its investment cycle for its real estate business. \nIt˜is working towards reducing the GHG emissions of its real estate \nportfolio to net-zero by 2050, in line with the Group™s commitment, \nand increasing the share of properties that have an environmental \nor sustainability certification. Looking ahead, activities plan to be \naligned with the 1.5°C decarbonization pathways for the global \nreal estate sector published by the Carbon Risk Real Estate \nMonitor˜(CRREM).2Embedding ESG in real estate\nAllianz Real Estate™s ESG integration framework is designed to \nimprove the ESG performance and transparency of real estate assets \nand address issues such as physical climate risks, reducing the risks of \nobsolescence and depreciation. Alongside this, it looks at the social \nimpact of the buildings on the community that uses them.\nThe framework is based on three key areas of activity: assess, \nengage and improve.\n1. AssessAssets are screened for potential ESG issues, particularly during the \nacquisition phase. Every new equity investment undergoes a thorough \ndue diligence process including technical and environmental due \ndiligence and property-related ESG assessment. Any new office, \nretail or logistics investment (equity) must have an environmental or \nsustainability certification that is either globally recognized (such as \nLEED or BREEAM) or locally dominant (for example HQE in France \nand DGNB in Germany). For new fund investments, fund managers are \nrequired to have an ESG policy or to be PRI signatory.\n2. EngageDuring the management phase, a collaborative engagement \nstrategy seeks to influence business partners to strengthen ESG \nactivities. This includes ensuring ESG topics are considered as \npart of performance review meetings with joint venture partners, \nsupporting external property managers to improve ESG standards \nand performance, and engaging with tenants to influence their \nchoice in fuel.\n3. Improve\nWe aim to measure and improve the ESG performance of our entire \nreal estate portfolio. This includes seeking out pilot ‚lighthouse™ \nprojects and group-wide initiatives, such as procuring certified \ngreen energy and investing in onsite energy production and energy \nefficiency measures like installing LED lighting.\nIn October 2020, Allianz Real Estate™s ESG approach was expanded \nand strengthened in the context of indirect investments and to \nincrease the emphasis on energy performance data collection for \nAllianz Real Estate-controlled and non-controlled areas, such as \ntenant areas. \nWe also finalized a new global carbon accounting and reporting \nframework which will drive more systematic environmental \nreporting across our portfolio. The framework will improve the \ncollection of actual energy performance data in the context of a \nglobally diversified real estate portfolio Œ a necessity to effectively \nsteer future decarbonization efforts. \nLooking ahead, we plan to conduct further energy audits to better \nunderstand energy performance and inform action plans to bring \ndown the energy consumption of assets. We aim to extend efforts to \nreduce carbon emissions in line with the Group commitment to drive \ndecarbonization. This includes for example, revising the technical/\nenvironmental due diligence scope of work to give greater \nconsideration to required actions and additional investments. \nIn˜depth ESG analysis in investment documentation is intended \nto˜place a stronger emphasis on these ESG considerations. \n1    \nInternational Energy Agency and the United Nations Environment Programme (2018): 2018 Global Status Report: towards a zero-emission, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector, page 9.\n2   Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM).\n42\n03.3\n Sustainability in asset management\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management   Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nFrom increased regulation to heightened \ncustomer demand, the integration of sustainability \nconsiderations in asset management is an important \nindustry driver.

We believe in the value of taking a long-term approach \nto investing. This means working with companies to help them build \nsustainable businesses, rather than reacting to day-to-day news flow. \nWe strive to steer investee companies towards sustainable business \nsuccess through corporate dialogue and proxy voting. Consistent with \nour investment philosophy and approach, we engage in dialogue \nwith investee companies and seek proactively to present a viewpoint, \neffect change where necessary and monitor the results of our \nengagement. Our investment views are influenced by the outcomes \nof engagements and are linked to the proxy voting process, forming˜a \nconsistent stewardship approach.\nEngagementWe see the value of engagement in sharing our knowledge, views and \nperspectives with boards and management of investee companies \nto help improve performance and to better assure their long-term \nbusiness prospects. We also find that exposure to a broader range of \nstakeholders at investee companies, importantly non-executive board \nmembers, enhances our understanding of the business, its strategy and \nvalue drivers, as well as our knowledge of the governance and culture \nof the companies we invest in, which enriches our investment analysis. \nCritically, it helps to assess quality of leadership and oversight, and to \nbuild confidence and trust in the board and management.\nWith 303 company engagements covering 491 topics in 224 \ncompanies and 29 markets AllianzGI again showcased strong \ncommitment to its engagement activities in 2020.\nIn addition to direct company engagements, we undertake \ntargeted thematic engagements, public policy engagements \nand participate in collaborative engagement initiatives aimed at \nimproving corporate practices and disclosure of information at an \nindustry or market level. With the launch of our dedicated climate \nengagement in 2021, we will further drive momentum towards \nclimate transition see separate section.\nProxy voting\nActive investment strategies benefit from the exercise of voting \nrights. We see proxy voting as a core part of our investment and \nstewardship processes. This also includes the careful evaluation \nof shareholder proposals, e.g. on climate or social issues. We have \nrobust policies for major corporate governance and proxy voting \nmatters and put substantial effort into developing and debating \nour views and positions. Our voting decisions are informed by \nin-depth research and analysis and discussions with investee \ncompanies and our proxy voting decision-making process involves \nclose collaboration between portfolio managers and ESG analysts. \nIn 2020, we voted at 10,183 shareholder meetings. In 72 percent of \nthe meetings we voted against management, withheld or abstained \nwith at least one vote. These figures reflect AllianzGI™s highly active \nand globally consistent approach to stewardship and a willingness to \nvote against proposals that do not meet its expectations of investee \ncompanies as well as fulfilling its duty to act in the interests of clients \nby considering each proposal on merit. \nWe consider voting on environmental and social matters a key part \nof our stewardship programme. During 2020, we showed strong \nsupport for shareholder resolutions on these matters. We backed \nalmost 90 percent of all proposals requesting improved reporting on \nclimate change and sustainability and 100 percent of proposals on \ncommunity environmental impact. Human rights were another area \nwhere we showed strong support, voting for almost 95 percent of all \nproposals. This includes any human rights items, such as improving \ncompany™s human rights standards or policies. \n  \nYou can find more detail on AllianzGI™s ESG related policies and proxy voting \nreports here.\nEngaging for a low-carbon economy \nRecognizing the importance of climate change and the power of \nengagement to drive real world impact, we launched in March \n2021 a dedicated climate engagement approach for certain \nstrategies. The approach aims to engage with companies on the \nclimate transition pathway towards a low carbon economy.\nHow it works\nAs proxy for climate change impact we identify the top absolute CO\n2 emitters per portfolio. In order to set realistic targets for each company, \nwe analyze best practices per sector and what each sector should \nachieve going forward. This analytical framework provides a solid \nbasis to define company specific engagement targets, which will be \naligned within our investment teams and documented in our global \nresearch and collaboration platform. Examples for engagement targets \ncould be greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets or board level \nremuneration targets linked to climate change. The engagements \nare performed centrally, tracked over time, their outcomes reported, \nand˜they support our investment and divestment decisions.\nUltimately Climate Engagement targets to improve risk adjusted \nreturns by helping companies to adjust their business models.\n44\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management   Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nSDG-aligned investing Œ investing with a purpose \nfor˛society\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations \ndefine global sustainable development priorities and aspirations for \n2030 and seek to mobilize global efforts around a common set of \ngoals and targets.

The thematic view provides an alternative framework \nto identify key enablers and beneficiaries along the change. \nInvestors participate in the investments that society will commit \nto˜in˜order to achieve the attainment of the SDGs.\nHow it works\nWe believe, investment decisions aiming to maximize positive \nenvironmental and social outcomes will lead to superior \nperformance over time. Therefore, our priority is to actively allocate \ntowards the thematic areas that require capital for financing the \nmost urgent needs. Within these areas, we tilt the stock allocation \ntowards companies with the biggest qualitative and quantitative \ncontribution to the achievement of the desired sustainability goals. \nAs the prioritization of capital needs and the degree of a company™s \ncontribution thereto changes with time, the strategy will be actively \nmanaged to react and adapt.\nThe strategies integrate ESG considerations and apply selected \nexclusion criteria to ensure companies held in the portfolio do \ncontribute to positive outcomes in an environmentally and socially \nresponsible way and are also well governed. Through this combined \napproach, the new fund range aims to focus the investment into \ncompanies with a net positive contribution to the environment \nand society.\nTriple return: Financial, Environmental˛and \nSocial˛Alpha\nWe believe that SDG-aligned investing delivers environmental \nand social returns alongside the financial performance. With˜an \nSDG-aligned approach, investors pursue resilient long term \ndifferentiated growth.\nSDG-aligned investing is the democratization of ﬁImpactﬂ \ninvesting: it follows the same ultimate investment intention, but \nby investing in listed equites offers liquidity and accessibility for \nall investors.\nWe expect companies with business activities aligned with \nSDGs to be more resilient against macroeconomic and political \nvolatility. Enablers for sustainable development goals benefit \nfrom regulatory tailwinds. \n45\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n   PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.3.2 PIMCO\nAn ESG leader in fixed˛income\nAs active investors, we know it is not enough to rely on yesterday™s \nperformance or past credentials Œ we must innovate, engage and \nactively decide where to invest, and where not to invest, for our \nclients today. \nAs a leading fixed income manager with an active investment \napproach, PIMCO seeks to evaluate risks and opportunities for \nthe investments it makes on behalf of its clients.\n We actively engage with issuers around the world to drive \ninnovation, encourage greater commitments to sustainability \ntargets and support new issuance of sustainable bonds. Our first \ndedicated climate bond strategy was launched in 2019 and we \nhave committed to create new sustainably themed and ESG-\nfocused strategies to meet increasing client demand. \nWe published our third ESG Annual Investment Report providing \na comprehensive overview across multiple ESG initiatives and our \nengagement efforts. \nFor the third consecutive year, PIMCO was rated A+ across all \ncategories in the PRI Assessment Report, highlighting the strong \ncommitment to sustainable investing.\nOur approach to ESG investing\nPIMCO™s approach to ESG investing rests on two pillars. Firstly, we \nintegrate ESG analysis into our broad investment research process. \nSystematically incorporating traditionally non-financial factors \ninto the research process provides a holistic view of the long-\nterm creditworthiness of issuers. PIMCO™s team of credit research \nanalysts assesses the ESG profile of issuers and includes a forward-\nlooking assessment to assign separate ‚E™, ‚S™ and ‚G™ and an overall \nESG score. The resulting assessments are proprietary and distinct \nfrom those provided by ESG rating providers.\nSecondly, for investors seeking greater ESG focus in their portfolios, \nwe have created a platform of ESG-dedicated solutions focused on \ndelivering financial returns while achieving sustainability objectives \nand driving positive environmental and social change.\nThese solutions include strategies that reduce the carbon footprint \nof portfolios, allocate meaningfully to impact bonds and support \nissuers committed to embedding sustainability factors into their \nbusiness models. \nBringing ESG into action: tools for ESG portfolios\nMeaningful engagement is a common priority across all areas to \ninspire voluntary agreements around a common goal that benefits \nall parties. While our engagement is not the sole factor driving \npositive changes made by these companies, we believe it has a \nmeaningful influence on the scope or timing of the commitments \nmade by issuers, as well as the disclosures that those issuers report \nto investors.\n1. Engaging through new bond issuance\nWe encourage corporate and sovereign issuers to advance their \nefforts by issuing a green bond or a bond linked to the SDGs. \n2. Addressing material ESG risks\nAs long-term investors with long lasting relationships with many \ncompanies, our role in the fixed income market enables us to \npartner with bond issuers to address long-term risks such as climate \nreadiness and sustainability. \nSustainability bonds\nWe have engaged with a leading energy transition company \nthrough the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) for several years on \ntheir commitment to renewables and more recently through \ntheir participation in the UNGC symposium on SDG bonds \nŒ hosted at PIMCO™s Newport Beach offices to encourage \ncompanies to issue SDG-linked bonds.\nIn response, in 2019 and 2020 the company issued General \nPurpose SDG-linked bonds (later called ‚Sustainability-linked \nbonds)™ Œ a first of its kind instruments where proceeds are used \nfor general corporate purposes and future coupon payments, \nare linked to targets addressing specific SDGs (25 basis point \n(bps) coupon step-up, if targets are not achieved).\nEngagement in the state-owned oil and \ngas˛sector The oil and gas industry continues to face persistent stakeholder \npressure on ESG, while progress from state-owned companies \nhave traditionally been limited. Through our market position, \nwe identify opportunities to engage with bond issuers in the \noil industry that are absent from the equity market. In one \ncase, our˜engagement aims to steer for ESG improvement and \naddress long-term ESG risks with one such oil and gas company.\nOn a quarterly to bi-annual basis, we continue to engage \nthe company on increasing the share of health &amp; safety \ncertification in operations and responses to oil spill and \ncontroversies. We deepened our discussion on climate in terms \nof setting targets on methane reduction, Scope 3 emission \ndisclosure, enhancing scenario analysis, etc., and shared our \nviews and references for areas of improvements across these \ntopics. In addition, we are also part of the CA100+ investor \ngroup to collectively engage the issuer on climate change.\nThe engaged issuer in this case has acknowledged the \ngrowing importance of climate change consideration in their \nbusiness and has responsively engaged in multiple exchange \nwith our team on ESG. They plan to align climate change \ndisclosure closer to industry standards and are reviewing \noptions to increase health and safety certifications over time. \nWe will continue to monitor the issuer™s progress and carry \nout constructive dialogue on their improvement towards \nbest practices.\n46\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n   PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n3. Establishing climate targets \nAs climate action becomes a mainstream talking point for corporate \nand sovereign issuers, it is the job of active managers to identify \nthose with innovative approaches to sustainability. This˜happens, \nthrough direct dialogue, engagement and collaboration with other \ncompanies and investors, sharing guidelines on best practices \nand expectations. It is also important to leverage bottom up \nresearch expertise and established relationships with issuers to \nprovide concrete recommendations that are applicable to their \nbusiness context.\n1   \n For background on the CA100+ initiative see also the CA100+ info box in section 03.2.1.\nOn-going engagement to promote climate \nstrategies and disclosure\nEngagement activities allow us to have a regular and on-going \ndialogue over several years.\nPIMCO has continued to emphasize best practices in terms of \nclimate strategy and disclosure, including the importance of \nratcheting up their carbon target and elaborating on their shift \naway from fossil fuels and their governance for climate change. \nThis specific issuer announced in September that they are \nrevising their climate goals and now aim to reduce by 60 \npercent (versus 50 percent previously) their CO\n2 emissions by 2030 versus 2010 levels and have a long-term objective to \nachieve net-zero carbon emissions (versus 80 percent with an \naspirational goal of net-zero previously) by 2050. They also \nfleshed out various incremental supportive measures that \nsuggest a potential acceleration in their low-carbon strategy, \nsuch as increased investments in solar and storage, planned \nretirement of coal plants.\n4. Collaborating with industry groups \nPIMCO partners closely with key industry groups to drive a more \nglobally coordinated ESG effort, including: \nU.N. Global Compact CFO Taskforce for the SDGs\n: A two-year \nproject which aims to mobilize hundreds of Chief Financial Officers \n(CFOs) to tackle the financing needs of the SDGs. Scott Mather, \nPIMCO CIO of U.S. Core Strategies will co-chair the project in \npartnership with the U.N. Global Compact and energy utility, ENEL. \nGlobal Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance\n: Launched by U.N. Secretary-General A. Guterres in October 2019, \nthe alliance consists of 30 CEOs who will focus on accelerating \nlong-term investment into sustainable development. The GISD \nwill deliver concrete solutions to scale-up long-term finance and \ninvestment which will specifically contribute to the realization of \nthe˜SDGs (see also the GISD info box in section 03.2.1). \nPRI Sovereign Working Group (SWG)\n: Provides practical guidance \nfor ESG integration and effective engagement in sovereign debt \ninvesting by analyzing material ESG risks and opportunities for \nsovereign bonds, identifying obstacles to further integration and \nestablishing rationale and boundaries to bondholder engagement. \nPIMCO™s engagement efforts in numbers \nPIMCO™s credit research analysts engage regularly with the \ncompanies they cover. Topics of discussion include company \nmanagement teams related to corporate strategy, leverage, \nbalance sheet management and ESG-related topics such as \nclimate change targets and environmental plans, human capital \nmanagement and board qualifications and composition. \nWhile we do not track every regular engagement a PIMCO credit \nresearch analyst has with an issuer, members of our dedicated \nESG credit analyst team do track PIMCO™s intensive ESG-focused \nengagements with corporate credit issuers that are being \nconsidered as investments for our ESG portfolios. \nIn 2020, PIMCO™s 75+ global credit research team engaged with \nroughly 1,600 corporate bond issuers which represents more \nthan 80 percent of PIMCO™s corporate holdings by market value, \nrepresenting issuers across industries and regions. Of the roughly \n1,600 corporate bond issuers engaged globally, more than 600 \nissuers were engaged in depth, with repeat discussions on specific \nESG topics and milestones monitored and tracked. These issuers \nrepresent almost 60 percent of the firm™s corporate holdings by \nmarket value. 47\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities03.1 Sustainability in insurance\n Integrating ESG in insurance\n Climate and renewables\n  \nNatural catastrophes\n Cyber security\n Emerging consumers\n03.2 Sustainability in proprietary investments\n  \nESG integration and \nengagement approach\n Sustainability-themed investments\n ESG in real estate investments\n03.3 Sustainability in asset management Allianz Global Investors\n PIMCO\n03.4 Sustainable solutions04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n03.4\n Sustainable solutions\nProviding responsible and innovative solutions \nrepresents a signi˛cant opportunity to grow our \nbusiness and contribute to a sustainable, low carbon \nfuture. As a leader in the emerging consumers sector, \nwe promote a more equitable society through access \nto ˛nancial products and services for people on \nlow˜incomes. \nIn 2020, we generated revenues totaling • 1,878.9 million\n1 from 232 \nsustainable solutions (2019: • 1,371.3 mn2) through our Sustainable \nSolutions program. They include: \nŁ 106 sustainable insurance solutions˚\nŁ 27 emerging consumer solutions\n3˚ Ł 38 insurance solutions with a sustainability component\n4˚ and Ł 61 sustainable asset management solutions5.Through our emerging consumer solutions, we have reached over \n10.1 million6 (2019: 10.0 mn) people living on low incomes in Asia, \nAfrica and Latin America with affordable microinsurance and micro-\nsavings solutions (see section 03.1.5). We are also a partner in the transition to a low-carbon economy, \ndelivering products and services with a positive environmental or \nclimate-related impact. Our insurance, risk management solutions \nand advice enable individuals, companies and governments to \nimplement renewable energy projects and manage climate-related \nrisks (see section 03.1.3).Allianz local entities and global lines work continuously to innovate \nand develop new and existing sustainable products and services \nfor customers.

It takes inspiration from automotive and other \nindustries by applying computer-aided design (CAD) principles \nto specify products in a fully digital and modular way. The APL-\nbased Allianz Global Offer Specification Tool allows users to \ndesign and specify insurance products for different markets \nand business lines in a fully digital and harmonized way Œ \nall based on Allianz Customer Model (ACM) principles (see \nsection 04.4 on additional details on ACM).

It aims to capitalize on positive impacts \nfor customers and employees brought about by the COVID-19 \npandemic which acted as a catalyst for the transformation we had \nalready started. The model includes a global framework and is \nbased on four pillars:\nEmployees:\n During the lockdown, our approach to flexible \nworking made us resilient and we want to ensure this continues \nacross all our operating entities. The model includes, among other \nfeatures, a˜global framework for remote working to guarantee our \nemployees™ ongoing flexibility. As we move forwards, we are aiming \ntowards a mix of working from home and office work to become \nthe norm. The physical health and mental well-being of our people \nhave been particularly tested this year and will remain one of the \nmain areas we are focusing on with the New Work Model to ensure \nwe adequately support employees to be healthy in their lives.\nAdditionally, we want to significantly reduce business travel by \nleveraging technology.

A culture where results matter more than \nphysical presence and hierarchical structures. Flexible and agile \nworking and offices turned into versatile places of collaboration, \ninnovation and exchange will speed up the cultural change.\nWe will support this change by transitioning to an organization \nthat is less hierarchical, faster and more agile. Lifelong learning \nfor all Allianz employees will help build the right leadership skills. \nOur #lead and #learn programs have already started to support \nthis change.Resilience\n: We will increase the resilience maturity of operating \nentities to ensure business continuity. At the same time, we will \nstrengthen the resilience of our global workforce through Strategic \nWorkforce Planning and the identification of the right skills to upskill \nand reskill our people according to evolving business needs. \nFair and transparent reward\nOur policy is to ensure equal pay for equal work, and work of \nequal value of all employees regardless of gender, sexuality, \nethnic˜background, family status or any other demographic factors. \nWe˜are committed to fulfilling all regulatory requirements with \nregards to equal pay in every market in which we operate. \nWe adopt best practices proven to support fair pay. This includes \ncollection and analysis of equal pay data and implementation of \nbest practices to remove bias from salary decisions. We monitor fair \npay measures across the organization as part of our ambition to \neliminate the equal pay gap globally.\nOur remuneration system provides a transparent and balanced \noffering to attract, motivate, retain and reward people in a fair \nand appropriate way using monetary and non-monetary rewards. \nAll employees receive local position and market-based fixed \ncompensation (base salary and in some markets additional fixed \nspecial payments such as tariff-mandated payments in Germany). \nEmployees may also be eligible to receive variable compensation. \nOur variable remuneration system aligns remuneration with \nindividual performance and achievement of Allianz™s financial \nand strategic goals. The ‚pay for performance™ culture allows us \nto operate effectively under different performance scenarios and \nbusiness circumstances while promoting risk control and avoiding \ninappropriate risk taking. \nWe obtain benchmarking information and review compensation \nannually to ensure our remuneration offering remains competitive \nin relevant markets. \nDeveloping a share ownership culture\nWe believe in fostering a share ownership culture to help motivate \nemployees to contribute to our strategy and digital transformation. \nIn 2020, the Allianz Employee Share Purchase Program (ESPP) \nwas extended to include employees in the U.K., bringing the \nscope of the Global ESPP to approximately 92 percent of the \ntotal Allianz population across 42 countries (2019: 41 countries˚ \n2018: 30 countries).\nThe ESPP is designed to provide eligible employees with the \nopportunity to purchase Allianz shares at a substantial discount. \nFor every three Euros employees invest, Allianz adds another one \nEuro into the plan for them. Shares purchased through the ESPP are \nsubject to a three-year holding period to promote long-term value \ncreation and align employees™ interests with those of shareholders. \nOver the past year, employee participation in the ESPP increased \nby almost 90 percent. \nAs productivity goals were met in 2019, Allianz offered a free share \n(or the equivalent in cash) to Allianz employees in more than 70 \ncountries to celebrate the success. \n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nGRIˆ˝ˆ-˙\nStrategic workforce planning\nOur strategic workforce planning approach compares workforce by \njob profile supply in the next five years against workforce demand. \nThis enables us to identify where to invest in our workforce and in \npreparing our people for the future. \nBy end of 2020, the program covered around 53 percent of the \nglobal Allianz workforce, up from 32 percent in 2019˚ due˜to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the rollout has been slightly delayed. \nThe aim is to increase to 80 percent by the end of 2021 and to \naddress the identified learning gaps through our Learning &amp; \nDevelopment strategy.\nWe have developed five-year strategic workforce plans to support \nthe digital transition and resilience with the focus on upskilling, \nreskilling and smart recruitment, while minimizing potentially \ndetrimental social and financial impacts.\nUnderstanding what the transition to a digital future means for \nAllianz and its people is a strategic priority. Digitalization will \nchange the composition of the future workforce Œ some job profiles \nare not going to exist and there will be new profiles and capabilities \ndeveloped alongside considerable changes in existing profiles and \nskills. This will require major upskilling and reskilling initiatives to \nprepare our workforce for the future. A smart recruiting strategy \nis crucial to ensure the acquisition of the right skills for the future, \n‚like-for-like™ recruiting should be avoided and emphasize new and \nstrategic relevant skills.\nWorking closely together with Allianz University, we are developing \nlearning packages and paths mainly in digital format through \nour learning platforms (LinkedIn Learning &amp; degreed) for our \nemployees to foster a lifelong learning culture.

We are also working to ensure a state-of-\nthe-art customer orientation in our HR functions to enhance \nemployee experience.\nEmployee rights\nAllianz actively strives to ensure that employee rights are protected \nacross all OEs. To support these principles, Allianz was one of the \nfirst companies to create pan-European worker participation \nstandards and to establish a European SE Works Council under the \nlegislation for Societas Europaea (SE) companies. At local level, \nemployee representation is widespread across Europe. The˜Allianz \nSE holding company has a supervisory board made up of 50 \npercent employee representatives.\n  \nFor information on how we respect human rights as an employer, \nsee˜section˜02.8.04.1.1 Diversity and Inclusion \nWe believe in equality of opportunity and that diverse minds \nand abilities make us more innovative, more resilient and better \nequipped for the future. We commit to providing a fair and \ninclusive working environment where everyone can succeed \nregardless of gender, age, ability, religion, sexual orientation \nor˜cultural background.\nThe diversity of our workforce enables us to truly understand the \nneeds of our equally diverse customers. Fostering an inclusive \nculture benefits the business and ensures that we are a credible, \ntrustworthy partner. Consistent with the Allianz Code of Conduct, \nwe have zero tolerance of discrimination and harassment in \nthe workplace. \nD&amp;I governance and engagement \nOur Global Inclusion Council has been in place since 2007. It is \nchaired by an Allianz SE Board Member and consists of senior \nexecutives from around Allianz Group. In 2020, the council played \nan important role in defining our new Diversity and Inclusion \nStrategy ‚Inclusive 21™. The˜new strategy is built around three pillars: \nEmployees, Customers and Brand &amp; Reputation and is embedding \ndiversity and inclusion in the whole business.Council members support Operating Entities around the globe to \nembed the strategy in their businesses. Progress towards global \nstrategic targets is reviewed regularly by the Allianz SE Board \nof Management. \nWe continuously train our leaders and employees on the topic \nof diversity and inclusion to raise awareness and reduce the \nnegative impact of bias in, for example, recruiting and talent \nmanagement.

Women™s Empowerment Principles and \nthe U.N. LGBT Code of Conduct. We underlined these commitments \nwith global and local internal and external campaigns to celebrate \nInternational Women™s Day, International Men™s Day, Pride, \nand˜International Coming Out Day.\nWe also signed the Valuable 500 commitment, a global movement \nworking to put disability on the agenda of business leadership. \nAllianz officially joined this movement and confirmed that we will \ncontinue working on increasing disability inclusion. We prominently \ncelebrated our global engagement on disability inclusion by \nparticipating in the #purplelightup2020 of the Allianz Arena \nin Munich. Increasing diversity at senior levels \nDiversity of minds flourishes when the company culture allows \npeople to bring their whole selves to work. Our progress in having \nwomen and people of different nationalities, generations and \ncultural backgrounds in senior roles is a clear display of having \nchallenged the status quo.\nIn 2020, the Allianz Board and senior leadership maintained the \nfocus on systematically supporting gender diverse employees \nin senior leadership positions and reached 20 percent women \non the Allianz SE Board of Management. Since January 1, 2021, \nwe˜have three women (30 percent) on the Board. To continue this \npositive trend, we need to retain a keen focus on the development \nof our talent pools and further increase our support for balancing \nwork and personal commitments. This is even more important \nfollowing the events of 2020 which have changed workplaces \nand impacted the entire workforce. Many employees are working \nunder challenging circumstances and women have been \nespecially impacted. \n04.1 Human resources\nEngaging employees through inclusion networks \nEmployee networks facilitate the sharing of best practices and \ncoordination, for example building vocal allies and mentoring \nprograms to create the momentum needed to achieve our diversity \nand inclusion ambitions.Around the world, a growing number of Allianz employees have \naccess to a community that makes them feel that they belong. \nFollowing the creation in 2019 of the global employee networks \nAllianz NEO (focusing on gender inclusion) and Allianz Pride \n(focusing on LGBT+ inclusion), we have established global network \nboards for both topics. The networks have been given a permanent \nseat at the Global Inclusion Council and are being sponsored \nby senior leaders. With over 15 local networks and strong cross-\nnetwork collaboration, the number of local initiatives has increased. \nLocal chapters are connecting to drive events and activities˚ \nfor˜example, hosting cross-operating entity panel discussions.\nThree further global networks are being established to connect local \nnetworks that engage in generational (Allianz ENGAGE), multi-cultural \n(Allianz GRACE) and disability inclusion (Allianz AllAbility).\n55\n33.3 % \nAllianz SE Supervisory\n Board status for diversity\n4 (Target 2021: 30 %) \n04.1 Human resources\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   Diversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nAwards and recognition \nRefinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index (global ranking) Œ \n Allianz was ranked top 7th in 2020\nFinancial Times Diversity Leaders (Ranking for diversity leaders \nin Europe) Œ 2020: #108 and #1 in Insurance Germany\nBloomberg Gender Equality Index (global listing) \nAllianz US Life: \nBest Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality List in 2020 provided \nby˜Human Rights Campaign Foundation \n#40 on 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials in 2020 provided \nby FORTUNE \nDiversity and Inclusion Champion in 2020 provided \nby InvestmentNews \nAllianz Suisse: \nSwiss LGBTI Label 2020 by Schwul-lesbischen \nBerufsnetzwerke Network and WyberNet \nAllianz Australia: \nEmployer of Choice for Gender Equality \ncitation in 2020 provided by the Workplace Gender \nEquality Agency \nAllianz U.K. : \n#29 in Inclusive Top 50 U.K. Employers™ Index \nin˜2020 provided by Inclusive Companies \nAllianz Germany: \nBest employer for women in 2020 provided \nby Brigitte \nAllianz Technology (in India): \n100 Best Companies for Women \nin India in 2020 provided by Working Mother &amp; Avtar \nAllianz Italy: \nTop Employer for Women in Insurance in 2020 \nprovided by Top Employer Institute \nAllianz Spain: \nEquality badge 2020 Œ provided by the Spanish \nWomen™s Institute and the Ministry of Equality \nWomen and diversity in leadership\n1 1 Data as of December 31, 2020.

The passport covers technology-focused IQ skills and \npeople-focused EQ skills Œ from digital leadership to storytelling \nand resilience.\nSince its launch in June 2020, the #lead platform has over 10,000 \npeople registered. Over 4,800 have completed the three online \nmissions comprising 14 hours of content. September 2020 saw \nthe launch of the #lead Experience Œ a sequence of four virtually \ndelivered trainings. As of December 2020, 970 participants have \ncompleted the #lead Experience with a total of 15,520 hours of \nvirtual leadership training, as a result over 700 Allianz Leadership \nPassports have been issued. \nDeveloping strong leaders\nAllianz™s long-term success depends on fostering strong leadership \nskills at all levels.\n#lead Empower (formerly the Allianz Leadership Development \nProgram ALDP) is a group-wide program for experienced leaders \nthat provides participants with development support for their \nnext career step to a senior executive role. In 2020, 38 of our high \npotential leaders started their journey, of whom 34 percent were \nwomen. These leaders represented 17 countries and 25 entities. \nThe Allianz Management Program (AMP) is designed to equip \nthe next generation of global Allianz leaders with the knowledge, \nmindset and skills to lead in an inclusive, meritocratic environment. \nIn 2020, it was completed by 63 participants, 29 percent of whom \nwere women, from 17 different entities.\nLeading with people development\nThe Allianz Leadership Passport case study\nSince 1890, all around the globe, we have been working hard to \nsecure people™s lives and to give courage to our customers for \nwhat™s ahead. That puts us in a perfect position to understand \nthat we can™t take our own future for granted. As markets change, \nwhat made us successful yesterday won™t necessarily be what \nmakes us successful tomorrow. We know that, if we want to \ncompete in the future, we need to equip our teams with the right \nskills and capabilities. That begins with our leadership. \nThe new business models that are emerging require a new kind of \nleadership Œ leaders will need to exercise emotional intelligence, \ndevelop a growth mindset and lead with an inclusive, ‚we™ mentality, \nas well as mastering digital opportunities.\nThe Allianz Leadership Passport\nTo attain their Allianz Leadership Passport, leaders will embark \non a continuous learning journey consisting of two parts. A˜self-\nled, online gamified learning on the ‚#lead Platform™ and a \nfour hour × four day ‚#lead Experience™, a virtually delivered, \ninstructor-led training. \nTo maintain their Allianz Leadership Passport, leaders continue \ntheir learning journey through the newly launched AllianzU \nlearning platform and complete 100 development points every \ntwo years.Development points are a mechanism for employees to track \ntheir own learning and development journey. Points are \nautomatically allocated by the AllianzU platform when you \nengage in a learning activity (e.g. class, video, podcast, books) \nand recorded on your profile. In general, one development point \nis the equivalent of one hour of learning. The Allianz Leadership Passport is for all people leaders at \nAllianz, regardless of level, experience or location. We define \na people leader as someone who manages two or more \ndirect reports. In the future, we may also consider leaders who \nfrequently manage people as part of a project.\nThe intangible benefits of such a program are quite varied˚ \nexamples of these are:\nŁ #lead Leadership Passport will help leaders to improve their AES \n(engagement) scores, leading to overall better team performance.\nŁ For experienced leaders, the leadership passport will give \nthem a unique opportunity to mentor people leaders with \nless experience or peers from a different area of the business. \nThey will also learn something from their mentees that they \nhadn™t expected. \nŁ For new people leaders, #lead will give them the opportunity \nto learn from more experienced leaders or peers from a \ndifferent area of the business. \nŁ Attractiveness to external candidates, internal talent \ndevelopment thus avoiding expensive recruitment and on- \nboarding processes, role modelling to other leaders and \nengaging the board in the development process. \n58\n04.1 Human resources\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n Diversity and Inclusion   Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nPerformance management and \ntransparent˛feedback \nAt Allianz, both people and performance matter. Our employees \nwant to know how they are performing and how to develop. \nThis˜feedback is most useful if it is regular and ‚in the moment™.\nOur Global Performance Management process related to the \n™What™ (annual priorities) and the ‚How™ (personal behavior) \ncovers nearly 50,000 employees, with the goal to cover all Allianz™s \nemployees worldwide as part of the HR Transformation project \nby the end of 2022. The three key touchpoints for employees \nand managers to discuss performance and development are the \npriority setting and personal development plan (PDP) process, \nmid-year check-in and year-end review. Ongoing multidimensional \nfeedback (from people leaders, direct reports, peers and others) \nto employees is also embedded in the performance management \nprocess to continuously help them improve performance and \ndevelop their capabilities. \nWe use multi rater to foster an open and honest feedback \nculture. It˜is an additional tool that helps employees gather \nmultidimensional feedback. Aimed at executive levels, it provides \nvaluable insights into perceived strengths and development needs. \nIn 2020, we enhanced its impact by running it prior to the mid-year \ncheck-in and we simplified the questionnaire to create a better \nuser experience.\nFollowing a successful pilot in late 2019, we have introduced a \nnew integrated performance and talent dialogue (PTD) as part of \nyear-end discussions for the whole Allianz Group. It aims to identify \nclear actions for people where it matters most and leverages high \npotentials to encourage a performance culture. The PTD comprises \na panel discussion focused on performance and development, \nretention and/or consequence management actions.\nAttracting talent\nIn 2020, Allianz recruited 19,564 (2019: 24,829) candidates and \naround three million viewers visited the Allianz Group career \nwebsite (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.careers.allianz.com/">www.careers.allianz.com</a>). We˜focused on leveraging \nnew technologies to recruit candidates Œ for example using \nGoogle Assistant™s voice technology to let applicants practice a job \ninterview with real-life questions. This is now˜available in French \nlanguage alongside English and German.To simplify the candidate experience, we continue to merge \ncontent˜from local career websites onto one online platform\n (www. careers.allianz.com). We have completed a similar exercise \non LinkedIn Œ the so-called ‚Life tab™ of our company page now \nunites jobs and career-related content of various local and global \nAllianz operating entities. An algorithm decides which content is \nshown based on a user™s LinkedIn profile. \nWe have started to use Net Promoter Scores (NPS) to track \ncandidate satisfaction with the online application tool and with \nthe recruiter and hiring manager during the job interview process. \nWith respect to the online application tool, we know many \ncandidates find the registration and application process too long \nand complicated Œ especially given they usually already store their \nrelevant CV information on networks like LinkedIn. We are laying \nthe groundwork to improve the candidate experience. By the end \nof 2021, we intend to implement a new global application system \nto simplify the process. This will see a reduction from having dozens \nof fields to fill in, in the current system to only five mandatory \nfields: first name, last name, phone number, e-mail address and \nCV upload. We will keep improving the experience candidates \nhave with both recruiters and hiring managers.

Further, the results of the global AES are analyzed by \nvarious geographic and demographic factors such as, for example, \ngender and generations, to enable the organization globally and \nour entities locally to derive targeted measures.\nThree focus areas highlighted to maintain or increase engagement \nin 2021 were: \nŁ Reward and recognition (65 percent favorable, up seven \npercentage points from 2019) Œ to be addressed by the equal \npay initiative and review of global benefits strategy including \ntransparency on pay benchmarking.\nŁ Learning and development (67 percent favorable, stable \nfrom 2019) Œ this will be addressed through a global mobility \nstrategy and talent brokerage, and the new global Career \nTrack framework.\nŁ Job and processes (71 percent favorable, up four percentage \npoints from 2019) Œ to be addressed by the New Work Model \ninitiative including the Agile@Scale initiative and acceleration \nof˜Strategic Workforce Planning. \nThe Employee Engagement Index (EEI) measures the extent which \nemployees are motivated to contribute to organizational success. \nThis internal index comprises four AES items covering the areas of \nemployee satisfaction, loyalty, pride and advocacy. \nIn 2020, the EEI score was 78 percent (2019: 72 percent). Based on \nthe˜feedback received, the score increased in 2020 due to the initiatives \nimplemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in particular.\nBased on feedback from the AES, we have launched a new Global \nHealth Program organized around five core dimensions identified \nas important to health and well-being by employees. \n  \nFor further details about the Allianz Engagement Survey results, \nplease˜see˜Table HR-11.\nAs a result of the 2019 focus areas, we saw marked improvements \nacross all three areas in the 2020 AES results with specific achievements \non the topic of Top Management and Strategy score (up seven \npercentage points from 2019). \nSocial dialogue 2.0 \nWe engage closely with employee representatives to support \nchange implementation, manage impacts on employees and \npromote opportunities.

Allianz is committed to being \nan inclusive workplace and supporting employees to be healthy \nin their lives. This commitment extends to physical, emotional \nand social health needs of our workforce. We will support our \nbusinesses in implementing priority actions which are relevant \nto˜their local circumstances.\nWe are a signatory of the pan-European agreement on guidelines \nconcerning work-related stress.\n1 Allianz SE™s management and the \nEuropean SE Works Council have also signed a Joint Declaration \non telework. This serves as good practice guidance for Allianz™s \ncompanies deploying telework and covers all aspects of flexible \nworking arrangements outside Allianz premises. \nWe offer flexible working in terms of location and hours, including part-\ntime jobs at all levels, to help manage work-related stress and work-life \nbalance. In 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak forced the majority of Allianz \nemployees to switch to remote working almost overnight. The transition \nwas handled extremely well by our˜workforce. We set up the New Work \nModel initiative to leverage our learnings from the pandemic and build \na more resilient and sustainable organization (see section 04.1).\nAt Allianz, we understand that support for parents through \nchildcare provision can be a major benefit. It can help support \ngender equality and work-life balance with a more inclusive \nand healthy workplace. Many Allianz businesses are working to \nprovide this support through formal policies and specific offerings \ncustomized to their local situations.\nAllianz is committed to encourage local businesses to support \nemployees and provide a range of global online support materials \nwhich can be customized to communicate the local provisions to \nemployees in line with legal requirements.\n1  EU-OSHA, Framework agreement on work-related stress.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future– \n ...the Work Well Program to manage work-related stress \nWe have placed great emphasis on addressing the root causes \nof work-related stress, offering effective solutions and making \nchanges to the work environment that enable employees to \nrealize their full potential. This important aspect has been \nintegrated as one of the New Work Model ambitions. The˜Work \nWell program, launched in 2015, aims to provide a healthy \nand productive workplace to enable our employees to reduce \nwork-related stress. It consists of eleven minimum actions to be \nimplemented by our top 50 Operating Entities to reduce stress in \nthe workplace, for example Employee Assistance Programs: 24/ 7 \nanonymous professional mental health support hotlines, eligible \nfor all employees.\nThe eleven minimum actions were developed to ensure that \nmanagers and employees are trained to recognize work-related \nstress and to regularly discuss stress and its consequences in their \ndaily routine. Furthermore, minimum actions to improve the work \norganization, e.g. supportive use of digitalization and IT, as well \nas professional psychological support were implemented.\nTo track the successful implementation of the Work Well \nprogram, the Work Well index (WWi) has been our global \nindicator for work-related stress since 2015. It evolved into the \nWork Well Index plus (WWI+) in 2019 by adding three additional \nquestions around access to required resources and processes \nin work environment. The WWi and WWi+ have enabled us \nto track the progress of health and well-being throughout the \norganization. The Index is a scientifically-validated tool that \nmeasures work-related psychosocial stress based on 13 equally \nweighted metrics. These metrics cover dimensions of demands, \nrewards, control, support, social capital and efficiency. A higher \nindex score is associated with less work-related stress. \nEfforts to implement the Work Well program globally have paid \noff. In 2020, the WWi+ score was 70 percent, up from 66 percent \nin 2019 and 64 percent in 2018 (recalculated including the new \nefficiency dimension introduced through WWi+). This surpasses \nour WWi+ ambition for 2021, which has been set to 66 percent in \n2019, indicating that our employees rate the company™s efforts to \nreduce work-related stress very positively. \nOur efforts around employee health and well-being have been \nacknowledged several times, including:\nAllianz Taiwan\nŁ HR Asia Best Companies to Work for in Asia 2018, 2019, 2020 \nprovided by HR Asia Awards Taiwan\nŁ Top Insurance Workplace 2020 by Insurance Business Asia\nŁ Taiwan/ Sport certificate by the Sports Administration of the \nTaiwan Ministry of Education\nAllianz Asia-Pacific Regional Office\nŁ Top Insurance Workplace 2020 by Insurance Business Asia\nAllianz SE\nŁ Excellent Corporate Health Management by the EUPD \nCorporate Health Award\n61\n04.1 Human resources\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n Diversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees   Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nHealth and well-being across our businesses\nIn 2019 and 2020, Allianz Asia Pacific drove standardizing of paid \nmaternity leave in Asia up to four months. Asia paid maternity leave \nis typically two months. Up until now, Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan \nhave implemented this extended financing of paid maternity leave.\nŁ Allianz SE has worked with a local partner to open an onsite \nsubsidized daycare facility for employees working in the Munich \nhead office.\nŁ Allianz Switzerland provides an inhouse day care facility \nfor employees.\nŁ Allianz Germany provides a day care centre for employees to \nimprove work-life balance at our Unterföhring office.\nTo improve health and well-being across Operating Entities, \nHealth˜and Well-being managers are responsible for driving \nactivities at OE level. They are required to do so in accordance \nwith local requirements and regulations and the Allianz Operating \nModel to ensure each Operating Entity applies the same high \nstandard of local health and safety management. This includes all \nactivities to meet local occupational health and safety standards.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...focusing on mental health in the year of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic \nIn 2020, the Global Health Days initiative increased the focus \non mental health and well-being. This was a virtual event \nbrought to all Allianz employees globally, with specific days \ndedicated to health and well-being throughout the year.\nThe initiative kicked off on June 23 Œ International Olympic \nDay Œ by celebrating Global Health Day at Allianz and paying \ntribute to the upcoming partnership with the Olympic and \nParalympic Movements in 2021. Virtual Zumba dancing \nclasses and inspirational talks by Paralympic athletes engaged \nemployees across five continents.\nOn October 8, we marked a day to focus on Global Mental \nHealth at Allianz. Colleagues from all over the world \nparticipated in virtual activity sessions and panel discussions, \nand received inspirational insights into the importance of \nmental health from colleagues and professionals.\nWe ran additional mental health initiatives during the \nlockdown, such as virtual meditation and yoga training and \nregular communication around the importance of mental \nhealth by the Allianz SE Board of Management. \nMany local mental health initiatives were conducted in addition \nto global activities. Examples include mindfulness teaser sessions \nhosted by the Allianz Technology Global Mindfulness Community \nand the implementation of a Mental Health Program by Allianz \nAustralia, featuring Mental Health Ambassadors and advocates. \nUnderstanding employee needs \nIn 2020, our main focus was on supporting employees™ health \nand mental well-being during the unprecedented period of \nuncertainty and social distancing. As part of the New Work \nModel, we˜conducted a global employee pulse check survey to \nidentify sources of work-related stress in times of remote working. \nOur˜employees rated five key areas of improvement as important: \nŁ the need for professional psychological support (22.3 \npercent favorability) \nŁ better training for people leaders (39.9 percent favorability) \nŁ additional corporate wellness programs \n (38.5 percent favorability) \nŁ regular employee feedback rounds (40.0 percent favorability)\nŁ improvement of our work organization (51.1 percent favorability).\nActing on employee feedback Œ health in action \nBased on employee feedback through the pulse check survey, \nwe plan to merge the Work Well Program into four Minimum \nHealth Requirements to take appropriate follow-up actions and \nto anticipate corporate health and well-being trends. The mental \nhealth and well-being of our employees is our ultimate goal \nand we therefore developed a consistent framework for all our \nOperating Entities around the world that comprises the following \nthree dimensions: Mental and Physical resilience, Motivation and \nEngagement as well as Work Effectiveness. The Minimum Health \nRequirements will ensure access to professional support hotlines \nfor all employees and effective training for all people leaders to \nmaintain health and well-being in their teams.\n62\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n   Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n04.2\n Data privacy and information security\nProtecting our customers and their data and \nmaintaining their trust are our highest priorities. \nOur customers, employees and other stakeholders \nexpect their personal information to be treated \nwith the utmost care and we take this responsibility \nextremely˜seriously.\n04.2.1 Data protection and privacy\nIncreasing digitalization comes with privacy challenges such as \nnavigating data privacy laws across jurisdictions and communicating \nwith clients through the digital channels they prefer in a data privacy \nresponsible manner. \nIt is our commitment to protect customer privacy and we cooperate \nclosely with other stakeholders involved in the update and \nmodernization of European privacy legislation, including industry \nassociations, members of parliament and authorities.\nThe E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which \nbecame effective on 25 May 2018, has increased attention on how \ncompanies comply with data protection requirements. Companies \nthat have been found to be deficient have been fined, in some \ncases, significant˜amounts. Defective data privacy practices can \nimpinge on the rights and freedoms of customers and employees. \nTogether,˜these˜consequences can lead to negative publicity.\nStrengthening our global privacy framework\nThe Allianz Privacy Standard (APS) is our global standard for data \nprivacy. It defines rules and principles for collecting and processing \npersonal data. The standard sets out six privacy principles that all \nemployees must respect, wherever they are in the world: due care˚ \npurpose specification˚ reasonable limitation˚ transparency and \nopenness towards employees and customers on where personal \ndata is stored and used˚ choice and consent˚ and privacy by design.\nWe publish a Privacy Notice which clearly states the type of \ninformation we collect and is accepted by our data protection \nauthority as our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). These BCRs allow \nAllianz Group companies to lawfully transfer personal data from \nwithin the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, where it \nis˜required for business purposes.\nOur group-wide privacy program continues to mature as we commit \nto provide services digitally as a matter of practice through our \nDigital by Default services. The program includes embedding robust \nprivacy controls such as privacy impact assessments, data ethics \nassessments and monitoring activities through a privacy-focused \nculture. This builds on the Allianz Privacy Framework which provides:\nŁ a global standard for data privacy (the APS)˚\nŁ a Privacy Impact Assessment and risk management process˚\nŁ integration with Information Security core functions˚ \nŁ data privacy and protection monitoring activities˚ and\nŁ training for employees on the appropriate processing of \npersonal data belonging to customers, employees and third-\nparty partners.\nAs the privacy program transitions from implementation to \nbusiness-as-usual, we will monitor privacy governance activities \nand processes across OEs. These status assessments will be used as \nbasis to embed enhanced integration of privacy obligations in day-\nto-day business. Monitoring activities include site visits, reviews of \nprogram documents, interviews and expert challenge calls.\nPrivacy risk management\nWe consider the identification and management of privacy risks \nat the operational process level to ensure they are measured, \nmonitored, and mitigated across our core businesses. \nPrivacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) of high exposure processes \nthat use personal data, for instance customer health data and \nemployee data, enable the early identification of risks to ensure \nthey are managed appropriately. \nIn 2020, we deployed a comprehensive suite of PIA guidance and \ntraining materials, including on-demand videos. These materials \nset a high standard for teaching privacy professionals about the \nPIA methodology. We also published a new global template \nfor undertaking PIAs which makes the process more robust \nand less burdensome for process owners. Over time, we aim to \nachieve superior insight into our use of personal data and a more \nsophisticated understanding of the risks arising from personal \ndata processing activities. Privacy risks are included in Allianz™s \nIntegrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) which helps us measure \nand monitor privacy.\n63\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n   Data ethics\n   Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\n4.2.2 Data ethics \nWe have set up the Allianz Data Ethics Project in response to \nthe increasing regulatory initiatives and public debates on data \nethics and artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide. The project brings \ntogether experts from various functions and OEs to strengthen the \ninternal governance framework for AI. The project also develops our \nposition on Data Ethics and AI in the regulatory field.\nIn 2020, we developed the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI for \nour data science and analytics departments. We also expanded \nthe Privacy Impact Assessment into a ‚Privacy &amp; Ethics Impact \nAssessment™ and reflected respective changes in the Allianz Privacy \nFramework to embed ‚Ethics by Design™ in our organization and \nincrease customers™ trust in AI solutions.\nCompliance with industry developments\nWe aim to stay abreast of regulatory and industry developments \nand reflect these in Allianz™s operational and governance processes \nand procedures. In 2020, we concluded efforts started in 2016 \nwith OEs and other Group Centers to deploy the Allianz Privacy \nRenewal Program. \nHaving achieved this milestone, the data privacy program has \nnow transitioned to a business-as-usual environment in which data \nprivacy matters are embedded into normal business processes and \nhandled as a routine part of our business activities.\nEngaging with employees\nWe engage with employees to ensure they understand the \nrequirements for handling confidential information and personal \ndata. In 2020, we deployed interactive confidentiality training in 20 \nlanguages which is mandatory for all employees. \nWe also provided refresher data privacy training for all employees \ninvolved in processing personal data, where legally required. \nNew employees continue to be on-boarded with global data \nprivacy training launched in 2018. Together, these trainings \nensure employees across the organization have a suitable level \nof knowledge concerning the principles of confidentiality and \ndata privacy.\nThe Allianz Digital Privacy Guidelines have been deployed across \nall OEs. They cover privacy-related topics impacting digital projects \nŒ both privacy by design (as part of new product and service \ndesign) and privacy by default (where individuals are given choices \naround the use and onward sharing of their personal data, and the \ninitial settings restrict disclosure).\nIn 2020, we continued to engage Allianz data privacy professionals \nthrough regular Privacy Community calls to discuss topical subjects. \nSenior Data Privacy Officer (DPOs) are engaged through the \nAllianz Privacy Advisory Group, which acts as steering board for the \nprivacy program. We also virtually hosted our fifth Allianz Privacy \nSummit to discuss the incorporation of data privacy principles into \nthe Allianz Custom Model (ACM), digital healthcare initiatives, and \nour use of cloud service environments.\nLooking ahead, we will continue working to ensure compliance \nwith GDPR and will update the Allianz Privacy Standard, functional \nrules, and privacy guidance to reflect regulatory changes and \njudicial decisions. We will also facilitate deeper engagement on \nprivacy-related issues across the Group, including through ongoing \ndata privacy training.\n04.2.3 Information security\nInformation security is managed globally through a robust and \nmature governance framework aligned to international standard \nISO 27001. This is closely monitored by a dedicated Chief \nInformation Security Officer (CISO) function and the Group Board \nof Management. An executive accountability regime supports the \nenforcement of the governance framework.\nThe governance framework comprises multiple layers of \ncorporate rules and processes to ensure information is not being \nused or accessed by unauthorized individuals. An overall policy \nestablishes core principles, roles and responsibilities as well as \nthe organizational framework for Information Technology and \nInformation Security within Allianz Group. Associated functional \nrules provide further details and specific implementation guidelines \nfor OEs. The functional rules are complemented by detailed \ndescriptions of best practices to be followed across 14 defined \ntopics to ensure the ‚security by design™ principle.\nCyber risk is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by \nAllianz. Maturity and cyber-health of OEs is tracked with a focus on \npeople, processes and technology. It is reported quarterly up to the \nBoard of Management and Supervisory Board. Monitoring of and \nmeasures against cyber-incidents are implemented on a global \nlevel and supplemented locally where required. \nSpecific measures to improve security controls are evaluated and \nlaunched semiannually with priorities assigned on a global, risk-based \nview. Measures managed across the Allianz Group focus on the five key \nrisk areas of: reducing the likelihood of incidents˚ increasing detection \nlikelihood˚ reducing damage from incidents˚ streamlining compliance˚ \nand training/educating the organization to further improve the \nsecurity awareness.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis task force was put \nin place to ensure business resilience and the existing protections \nand ongoing measures were reviewed. Further emphasis was put on \nprotecting users working remotely and ensuring existing processes \ncontinue to work as efficiently remotely as they do with a work-\nforce on-premise. This includes strengthening technical defenses \nfor common types of cyber-attacks and altering training and \nawareness regimes to deliver impact with a distributed workforce.\n64\n04.3\n Regulatory and public affairs\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nGiven the challenges facing society, we must come \ntogether across governments, institutions, sectors \nand companies to deliver sustainable outcomes. \nAs˜Allianz, we participate in regular, open exchange \nwith political stakeholders and actively contribute to \ndebates on societal and industry-speci˛c challenges. \nThis includes dialogues with governments and \nrepresentatives to explore societal issues and support \npolicy development.\nSupporting policy development\nWe actively engage in political advocacy as part of the democratic \nprocess, contributing our expertise and insights to help tackle \nregulatory and societal challenges. All outreach and political \nnetworking activities are undertaken in line with the Allianz Code \nof Conduct which mandates minimum standards for contacts with \nrepresentatives of politics, private sector and society. Allianz is \na signatory of the European Union Transparency Register Code \nof˜Conduct.\n1 Outreach and political networking\nGroup Regulatory and Public Affairs (GRPA) is the center of \ncompetence for all Allianz regulatory and political activities. \nIt supports operating entities to develop regulatory and \npolitical strategy and oversees management of regulatory \nand˜political topics.\nWe are committed to respectful and cooperative interactions with \ngovernments, regulators and supervisors across every touchpoint, \nincluding regular contacts and specific requests, examinations and \ninvestigations. We strive to provide an honest, fair and timely response \nto all requests.\nGRIAs part of our commitment to democracy, we have made financial \ncontributions to political parties that support the social market \neconomy for many years. In 2020, Allianz Germany contributed \n•˜20,000 to the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), \nthe˜Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU), the Social Democratic \nParty of Germany (SPD), the Green Party and the Free Democratic \nParty in Germany (FDP) respectively. Every party™s youth organization \nreceived a grant of • 10,000 to support their focus on social issues \nof the future. Because we donate below the German Bundestag \nreporting threshold of • 50,000, we publish a press release outlining \nAllianz™s political donations.\nAllianz positions\nOne of the roles of GRPA is to develop and uphold Allianz™s position \non current and emerging regulatory and societal issues. In 2020, key \ntopics included:Capital Markets Union (CMU)\n: Allianz welcomes the EU™s CMU \nAction Plan on the integration of national capital markets into a \ngenuine EU-wide single market for capital. We support the idea of \nan EU economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis that is green, \ndigital, inclusive and resilient by making financing more accessible \nfor companies, in particular for SMEs. We actively contribute to the \npolicy debate and corresponding consultations.\nDigitalization:\n We actively engage in discussions and consultations \naround the EU™s digital strategy. We support efforts to improve EU™s \ncyber resilience, establish trustworthy artificial intelligence and \nharmonize the responsibilities of online platforms and information \nservice providers. Allianz also endorses the establishment of a \nEuropean data space based on European rules and values and the \ncreation of a widely accepted public electronic identity (eID).\nPrudential regulation:\n While Solvency II has been functioning well \nsince its introduction in 2016, we believe that the ongoing legislative \nreview should be used to provide some modifications to better \nreflect the economics and true risks of the long-term insurance \nbusiness model, while upholding policyholder protection. \nThis would remove unwarranted restraints on insurers™ long-term \nold age provisioning solutions and better facilitate stable, long-\nterm financing of the real economy, in particular of sustainable \ninvestments. In parallel, sustainability assessments should be \nfurther integrated in risk management processes, including the \nconsideration of business relevant climate change scenarios. \nAllianz˜participates in consultations, impact analysis and working \ngroups on these topics.\nSustainability: We are convinced that the financial services industry \nhas a duty to support the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient \nand sustainable economy by integrating sustainability considerations \ninto core business activities. We actively engage in discussions and \nconsultations around the EU™s sustainable finance agenda including \nthe EU Taxonomy Regulation, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure \nRegulation and the review of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive. \nIn order to steer sustainable investments successfully, and identify \nand˜manage sustainability risks correctly, we deem the availability, \nhigh˜quality and comparability of sustainability data as essential.\n1  Source: European Commission: Transparency register.\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...the Sustainable Finance Implementation Project \nAllianz has set up a cross-functional Sustainable Finance \nImplementation Project to support implementation of the \nE.U. Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) and \nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) (Regulation \n(EU) 2019/2088) across Allianz operating entities in Europe. \nIt˜develops blueprints for content disclosure and provides legal \nsupport to address questions and support data provision and \nbest practice sharing. This will help to ensure consistency in \ndisclosure and efficient processes. The first milestone is the \nimplementation of SFDR disclosure requirements (Level 1) by \nmore than 25 operating entities. The project interacts closely \nwith GRPA and provides practical information for consultations \nand engagement with respect to the E.U. sustainable \nfinance agenda.\n65\n04.4\n Customer satisfaction\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nWe believe the closer we are to our customers, \nthe˜better we can be there for them when it matters. \nTo stay relevant for today™s customers, we must be \npart of their everyday lives.

We aim \nto ensure they are heard and inject their feedback in everything we \ndo. The Allianz Customer Excellence program is focused on better \nunderstanding customer experiences by collecting direct personal \nfeedback. It uses a three-step model to understand and meet \nthe needs of our diverse global customer base: measure, analyze \nand act. \nWe collect direct customer feedback using proven and tested survey \ntools and methodologies. We act on what we learn˚ customer feedback \nshapes our products, services, communications and processes and will \nenable us to offer easy and adaptable solutions.\nGiving our customers a voice\nOur Voice of the Customer program applies a holistic approach \nto monitoring and improving customer journeys by collecting \nreal-time feedback. We send out surveys using a standard rating \nmethodology and invite customers to state their satisfaction level \non a five-star scale at touchpoints along five customer journeys. \nIf˜customers rate their experience with us with three stars or less, \nwe˜follow up within 48 hours to gather more insights and resolve \nthe issue directly with the customer. \nWe aim to use these learnings to make systematic improvements \nto our internal processes. This enables us to optimize a customer™s \nexperience when dealing with us. For transparency, we strive to \npublish all˜‚motor claims™ customer feedback on our websites. \nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by making it simpler for customers to \nmake˛claims \nOur research\n1 shows that, for 58 percent of insurance \ncustomers, the biggest concern they have before contacting \nthe insurer is whether their damage is covered. This highlights \nthe importance of having simple terms and conditions so that \ncustomers can understand the products they are buying. \nOur customers need to be able to understand what is covered \nto feel secure in contacting us about a claim. 61 percent of \ncustomers said this would lead them to immediately report \ntheir claim. Another 66 percent agreed on the need for \npersonal contact throughout the claims process, particularly \nvia phone. Customers have a clear preference for end-to-end \nownership of the claim by one handler and for 24/7 availability \nof call centers. \nWe have worked to embed customer insights such as these \ninto the design of ACM. Claims Handlers will be given end-\nto-end responsibility for claims so that they are empowered \nto make decisions. We limit the number of add-ons to three \nper product offer to keep choices simple and provide clear, \nnon-technical communication and interactions tailored to the \ncustomer™s preferences.\nBy the end of 2020, 19 operating entities and two global lines had \nimplemented the Voice of the Customer program, covering 70 \npercent of our customer base. We will reach the full scope in 2021.\nMeasuring customer loyalty\nWe use the globally recognized Net Promoter Score® (NPS) as our \nkey metric for measuring customer loyalty through their willingness \nto recommend the company. Applied annually according to global \ncross-industry standards, the NPS enables benchmarking against \ncompetitors and industry peers.\nOur target is for over 75 percent of Allianz Group business segments \nto score above market or at Loyalty Leader position and 50 percent \nat Loyalty Leader position by 2021. In 2020, we exceeded this target \nby achieving 79 percent outperforming (2019: 70 percent) and 60 \npercent Loyalty Leaders (2019: 46 percent). \nThe main drivers for this improvement were addressing customer pain \npoints via the Voice of the Customer program, product simplification, \ndigital service and measures in response to COVID-19. Customers who \nwere aware or experienced the COVID-19 measures put in place by \nAllianz showed an average of 25 percentage points higher NPS score \nthan customers without this experience.\n1  \nBased on ACM customer research on late First Notification of Loss (FNOL), conducted in \nGermany in 2019 and France, Italy &amp; Spain in 2020.\n % \nAllianz Group business segments scored above \nmarket or achieved a loyalty leader position in 2020\nˇˆ %\n target\nfor Allianz Group business segments to score above \nmarket or in a loyalty leader position\n (by 2021)\n67\n04.5\n Compliance\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nOur success is built on the trust our customers, \ninvestors, employees and the public have in our \nperformance and integrity.

It outlines our basic principles, values that provide guidance \nfor everyday decisions and conduct for all employees.\nAs part of a project led by Group Compliance, the Code was \nfundamentally renewed in 2020 and approved by the Board of \nManagement to replace the previous version from 2006. The updated \nCode includes an introductory message from the Group™s CEO, a \nclear link to the new company purpose and relevant topics beyond \ntraditional compliance Œ including feedback culture, diversity, inclusion \nand ESG. It considers feedback collected from global employees on \nvalue perception and provides a more compelling storyline referencing \nAllianz™s people™s attribute statements, a more conversational tone and \nan inspiring design with interactive features. \nGRIRollout to OEs started in September 2020 for implementation by \nmid-2021. A successful rollout requires that the Code is promoted \nby local top management and made known to all current and \nfuture employees. \nZero tolerance of fraud and corruption\nAllianz takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption. \nWe are committed to complying fully with local and international \nanti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Our aim is to go beyond \ncomplying with the minimum standards of the law, such that the \nAllianz Anti-Corruption Program sets standards for a consistent \nand comprehensive group-wide approach in every jurisdiction. \nThe˜program requires that employees and certain third parties with \nwhom Allianz does business are prohibited from offering, accepting, \npaying or authorizing any bribe or any other form of corruption, be it \nwith the private sector or with government officials. Anti-Corruption \ntraining is compulsory for all employees with online and classroom \ntraining delivered in multiple languages.\nAnti-money laundering\nIn accordance with applicable legal requirements, OEs establish \nrisk-based policies and procedures for the prevention of the \ncompliance risks, money laundering and terrorism financing on \nthe basis of customer identification, verification and monitoring, \nas˜well as suspicious activity reporting. We employ various \nscreening and monitoring systems and processes to manage risks \nand ensure compliance with anti-money laundering requirements \nand˜economic sanctions restrictions.\nRespecting economic sanctions and embargoes\nWe have global policies and procedures in place for compliance \nwith trade and financial sanctions. These include, among others, \nrequirements for the screening of customer and counterparty \nnames against the sanctions lists provided by the U.N., E.U. and \nthe U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Allianz™s global \nrequirements also include an enhanced review requirement for \nhigh-risk transactions related to countries, sectors or parties subject \nto sanctions restrictions.\nDue to the nature of our client™s underlying business transactions, \nsome of Allianz™s insurance coverage and other business can relate \nto countries, sectors or parties subject to sanctions restrictions. \nFor example, where permitted, we may issue insurance for \nhumanitarian services provided by our clients in sanctioned \ncountries. The Allianz Sanctions Compliance Program aims to \nensure we respect all applicable sanctions restrictions, and that \nthese high-risk transactions undergo enhanced scrutiny.\nCompetition \nWe believe fair competition and access to the market drives \ninnovation, stimulates growth and benefits the consumer. As a \nglobal player and a leading provider in our sector, we have a \nresponsibility to act in compliance with competition law. To meet \nthis responsibility, the global Allianz Antitrust Program consists \nof the Allianz Antitrust Standard which was updated in 2020. It \nlays out core principles and measures to be adopted across the \nGroup in order to ensure compliance with antitrust law as well as \nthe Allianz Antitrust Code. The Code was also updated in 2020 \nand provides a set of core behavioral rules that employees must \nobserve when dealing with competitors, customers and business \npartners. We regularly provide classroom and online trainings to \ntop management and exposed employees to refresh and develop \ntheir understanding of antitrust rules and how they affect their \ndaily business.\n68\n04.5 Compliance\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nLeadership structure\nGood corporate governance forms an integral part of our corporate \nculture and represents a foundation on which to build trust.

We have committed \nto reduce GHG emissions by 30 percent per employee by 2020, \nagainst a 2010 baseline. \nBy the end of 2020, we have achieved a 62 percent reduction \nper employee (2019: 35 percent). We met the 2020 target mainly \nthrough energy efficiency improvements from data center \nconsolidation and the increase in the share of renewable power \nin our energy mix. The target was further exceeded as a result \nof reduced business travel and an increase in work-from-home \nmeasures due to the pandemic.\n  \nFull details of our GHG emission disclosure, including by Scope 1, 2, and 3 \nemissions, are provided in \n Table ENV-2.\nReducing energy consumption\nOur 2020 target was to reduce energy consumption in office \nbuildings per employee by 30 percent compared with 2010. \nWe have exceeded our 2020 target, with a 50 percent cut in \n2020 (2019: 37 percent). This is mainly due to local data center \nclosures in remaining locations as part of the Group™s data \ncenter consolidation.\n Details of Allianz™s energy consumption can be found in \n˜Table ENV-3.\nRenewable energy\nAs a signatory of the RE100 initiative, we have committed to source \n100 percent renewable power for our group-wide operations \nby 2023.  You can read more about this commitment on our website. \nWith operations in more than 70 countries, we will need to engage \ndeeply with suppliers and landlords to achieve this ambition. \nIn˜2020, 57 percent of the electricity we used came from renewable, \nlow-carbon sources (2019: 49 percent) (see˜\n˜Table ENV-3). \nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...the journey towards 100 percent renewable \nenergy can™t be done alone \nAs part of the commitment by Allianz Group to switch to 100 \npercent electricity from renewable sources, Allianz Australia \ntook first important steps on this journey and it becomes clear \nthat this ambition cannot be achieved alone.\nAllianz Australia commenced its transition to renewable power \nby working with the existing supplier to arrange a phase out \nof term electricity contracts to renewable power. This action \nis directly in our control, making it an easy place to start. \nThe˜phase out will continue as more electricity contracts come \nup for renewal.\nThe need for systematic collaboration became clear when \nthe operations of Allianz Australia were reviewed: our offices \nacross Australia are leased and much of the electricity we \nuse is not within our procurement control. Some tenancies \ninclude electricity supply and all buildings include a portion of \ncommon area electricity which is split between tenants.\nAlso, electricity procurement and renewable generation varies \nacross Australia. As a result, Allianz Australia has taken the first \nsteps to engage all relevant stakeholders, including suppliers, \nto drive this important topic forward whilst giving consideration \nto local context when developing and implementing plans. \nA comprehensive stakeholder engagement plan is under \ndevelopment to drive progress through collaboration. \nCutting GHG emissions from business travel\nBusiness travel in 2020 accounted for 26 percent of GHG emissions \nfrom operations (2019: 37 percent). The protective measures \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic played a material role in this \nreduction. Going forward, our New Work Model (see section 04.1) \nwill capitalize on this shift to minimize emissions from business \ntravel by enabling flexible working. As part of our transition to \nlow-carbon operations, we are also working toward, a shift to \nhybrid and e-vehicles in our corporate fleet, see section 04.8 for \nfurther information.\nGRIGRI ˘˝˙-\nChange in energy consumption\n  \ngigajoules per employee\n˜˚˛˝˜˚˛˙˜˚˜˚˜˚˛˜˜˝˛˝˜˙˛ˆ72\nCarbon credit investments\nCarbon-neutral since 2012\nAllianz has been carbon-neutral since 2012 by investing in projects \nthat offset its operational emissions. In 2020, we retired carbon \ncredits equivalent to 203,352 t CO\n2) by investing in low-carbon initiatives, each credit accounting for one \nmetric ton of carbon. The˜savings in emissions are independently \nmeasured and certified once a year.\nWildlife Works Carbon LLC\nWe hold a 10 percent share in WWC, the world™s leading developer \nof Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \n(REDD) projects. This investment supports forest protection in Kenya \nand the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Kenyan Kasigau \nCorridor REDD project aims to offset one million tons of carbon \nemissions per year, while the DRC REDD+ project achieves an \naverage of 5.7 million tons of carbon reductions per year.\nRimba Raya\nWe began investing in this REDD project in Borneo, Indonesia, \nin˜2013. By helping to prevent the deforestation of nearly 65,000 \nhectares of peat swamp forest, the world™s largest project of its kind \naims to avoid more than 130 million tons of carbon emissions.\nPaper reduction\nThe nature of our business often requires formal communication \nand documentation for our customers and paper consumption is \na material use of natural resources. Our efforts to reduce paper \nconsumption are underpinned by the increasing shift towards \ndigital communication and further reducing our paper use when \nworking in our offices.\nOur target was to reduce paper use by 40 percent per customer policy \nby 2020 against a 2014 baseline. By the end of 2020, we had achieved \na reduction of 57 percent (2019: 50 percent as restated in 2019) Œ \nmeaning we achieved our 2020 target (also see \n˜Table˜ENV-9).\nChange in paper consumption\n2 grams per policy\n˜˚˛˝˜˚˛˙˜˚˜˚˜˚˛˝˙˝˛˝ˆˇ˛˝Collaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by going paperless in India\nThe Allianz Services office in Trivandrum, India, is our first \npaperless office. The initiative was made possible by the support \nof employees who worked together to develop innovative \nprocesses to eliminate paper from daily use. The˜three actions \nbelow provide a glimpse of the holistic approach of business \n(client-end) processes, central operational processes and the \nchange in facilities that enabled the reduction of paper use:\n1.  Business processes such as U.K. Cashiers process introduced \ndigital signature to replace the month-end practice that \nrequired reconciliation copies to be printed, signed and \nscanned to send to GHO Team.\n2.  Central finance processes like Accounts Payables and \nEmployee Reimbursements processes moved to online tools \nand invoice management was digitalized.\n3.  Facilities were fitted with digital displays &amp; interactive media \nfor visual communication and training material.\nDue to this achievement and other eco-friendly designs, \nthe˜Ganga building has repeatedly won the National Society \nof Energy Engineers and Managers (SEEM) award for \nenergy efficiency.\nReducing water use\nWater is a shared resource and minimizing our water consumption \nis a key principle commitment under the Group Environmental \nGuidelines. This is of particular relevance in areas at risk of water-\nstress. Approximately two-thirds of Allianz employees are situated \nin countries with medium to extremely high water stress\n1. To reflect \nthe increasing need to use water as efficiently as possible, we have \ncommitted to a target for water reduction in our offices for the first \ntime. See our new environment targets beyond 2020. (Also see \n˜Table ENV-7).\nDriving down waste\nWe aim to minimize the waste we generate and to re-use or recycle \nmaterials wherever possible (see \n˜Table ENV-8).\nAllianz employees also actively support local clean-up activities in \ntheir local communities. Despite the difficult and uncertain situation \nresulting from the pandemic in 2020, Allianz once again partnered \nwith World Cleanup Day. The event encourages employees, \ncustomers and the general public to unite and increase awareness \nof the global waste pollution problem. Besides traditional clean-up \nevents, the campaign shed light on the environmental impacts of \ntechnology. It promoted digital clean-ups to empty unused e-mails \nand folders to free up space on servers to reduce associated energy \nconsumption.

For example, \nour new digital travel and expense solution, which is already live in \nGermany, France, U.K., India, Switzerland and Romania, includes a \nflight search module. This provides transparency over GHG emissions \nfor each journey and includes a˜sort function to enable users to \neasily identify and book the flight option with the lowest carbon \nimpact. The air/rail comparison module also shows train and air \noptions in a combined display to encourage the traveler to take more \nenvironmentally conscious decisions. Similar principles are applied \nthrough the company car configurator, which includes a C.\nWe are extending our ordering catalogues to include suppliers that \nprovide eco-friendly stationery and products and to provide eco-\nfriendly promotional materials. A similar approach is adopted in the \nselection process of preferred hotels, where we assess sustainability \nstandards during the ‚request for proposal™ phase. In addition, \nwe are working to make internal operational ordering processes \npaperless by digitalizing approval and documentation Œ for \nexample travel approval processes have been changed from paper \nto digital workflows.Collaborating for a sustainable future...\n ...working with suppliers to encourage \n‚Restore˛over Replace™ Customer behavior\nOur procurement teams in the U.K. have focused on influencing \ncustomer demand through the motor claims process by piloting \na ‚Restore over Replace™ philosophy in partnership with suppliers. \nIt prioritizes suppliers of high-quality engineered vehicle repairs \nand has the added benefit of speeding up the claims process \nfor customers by 80 percent. Over the past nine months, \nthe˜partnership prevented over 2,000 kg of waste from ending \nup in landfill. The launch of a ‚green parts™ initiative offers motor \ninsurance customers the opportunity to choose recycled parts for \ntheir vehicle repairs. The parts are undamaged salvaged vehicle \ncomponents, saving the need to manufacture from scratch and \nsupporting the circular economy.\n  \nLearn more about Sustainable claims procurement by listening to this \nepisode from Allianz UK™s Insurance Tomorrow podcast.\nChanging energy consumption to green energy\nTo support our commitment to the RE100 initiative, we have identified \nopportunities where procurement can make great positive impact. \nOur strategic data centers are already well on their way to achieving \n100 percent certified renewable electricity usage and we are now \naiming to shift facility energy consumption worldwide to green \nenergy. We are also exploring the inclusion of energy consumption \nfrom suppliers™ cloud services into the scope of our commitment. \nWhere suppliers use energy on our behalf, we aim to encourage \nthem to move to green energy or to compensate adequately for the \nenergy they consume. We are collaborating with industry leaders of \ncloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, \nand will begin conducting periodic controls. \nLooking ahead \nTo further develop our supplier network with a continued emphasis \non sustainability and transparency, we must constantly analyze our \nspend on commodities and identify the right levers, commodities \nand suppliers to manage impacts on people and the environment. \nWe are investigating options to integrate ESG ratings into our \nsupply category concepts.\n1  \nIncludes suppliers with a spend volume greater than •250,000. Low-value and one-off contract \nsuppliers are currently out of scope.\nDeveloping our policies and standards\nNew Fleet PolicyWe are revising car fleet policies across the Group to reduce the \nnumber of cars with fossil-fuel-based combustion engines by \nlimiting orders to only hybrid and electric cars. The roll out in 2021 \nwill be supported by supplying charging cards for public charging \nstations and charging infrastructure for employees at home. \nIn Germany, we promote the use of a train pass to enable \nemployees to use most long-distance and regional public \ntransportation throughout the country. The aim is to encourage \nuse of public transport as an alternative to a company car with \npersonal taxation benefits paid by Allianz. \nAllianz Group Standard for Procurement\nOur new Group Standard for Procurement requires that supplier \nselection decisions are based on objective and transparent criteria, \nincluding carbon footprint data. It also requires suppliers above \na certain spend threshold to meet the standards set out in the \nAllianz Vendor Code of Conduct.\n1 This is aligned with International Labor Organization (ILO) standards and the U.N. Global Compact \n(UNGC). The requirement is integrated in the registration and \nscreening process together with questions related to environmental \nmanagement as a prerequisite to sourcing and contracting into the \nGroup procurement system.\nNot all suppliers accept the Allianz Vendor Code of Conduct. \nWhere˜this is the case, we apply alternative approaches to manage \nESG risk. They include reference to industry codes of conduct like the \nElectronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) or Bundesverband \nMaterialwirtschaft, Einkauf und Logistik (BME).\n100 percent of global suppliers, representing a total spend of \n•˜1.5 billion, committed to the Allianz Vendor Code of Conduct \n(2019: 97 percent). \nGlobal Sourcing and Procurement and Global Sustainability \ncontinued their collaboration to improve processes for conducting \nESG assessments for potentially critical suppliers.\nGRI˛˝˙-ˇ74\n04.9\n Societal impact\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted every area of life, \nhealth and livelihoods worldwide. Allianz operating \nentities responded by mobilizing resources to support \ncommunities around the world. Our new strategy aims \nto increase our positive impact on local communities, \nwith the key focus on next˜generations. \nOur contribution as a corporate citizen has never been more \nimportant. The pandemic has shone a spotlight on systemic societal \nchallenges, with inequality and civil unrest accelerating under the \nuncertainty and social challenges. \nIn recognition of this and in response to stakeholder feedback as \npart of our materiality assessment (see section 02.5), our Corporate \nCitizenship Strategy has evolved. \nIt provides a more holistic approach to our social impact activities \nas an evolution to our previous Encouraging Future Generations \nProgram, which was introduced in 2016 (see section 02.3). \nFostering and enabling self-sustaining livelihoods \nfor the next generations\nWe have committed to strengthen our long-standing approach \nto supporting children and youth by fostering and enabling self- \nsustained livelihoods of the next generations. Our new strategy \nhelps us to further mobilize efforts and resources at global and \nlocal levels to create lasting impact to our communities. \nIn 2019, the world population consisted of more than 2.2 billion \nchildren and 1.2 billion youth. These young people are the leaders, \nemployees, customers and investors of tomorrow. We are uniquely \naware that the decisions we make today will shape their lives in the \nfuture Œ pension systems, environmental and climate protection, \nand investments in education all have long- term consequences. \nMany of our social impact programs and initiatives run by local \nentities and our 12 Allianz-affiliated foundations contribute to the \nstrategic mission. While many of the onsite volunteering activities and \nprograms had to be canceled or postponed, in 2020, Allianz Group \ncorporate giving doubled, mainly in support of efforts surrounding \nthe COVID-19 crisis. \n For examples read more on our #AllianzforLife page\n.Our combined contributions totaled • 50.3 million\n1 (2019: • 24.2 mn) \nand 56,655 hours2 (2019: 115,057 h) in corporate volunteering. \nThe Allianz and SOS Children™s Villages partnership\nOur long-term global partnership with SOS Children™s Villages \nInternational (SOS-CVI) supports our mission by tackling the \nbarriers to becoming self-reliant and increasing resilience of \ntoday™s youth. We do this through joint efforts across a number of \nstrategic initiatives: \nEmergency Preparedness &amp; Response\n Œ Natural and man-made \ndisasters threaten the livelihood of millions of people worldwide \nand children are disproportionally affected. Our Emergency \nPreparedness &amp; Response support increases the resilience of \nyoung people, their families and surrounding communities for a \nsecure future.\nYouth Employability\n Œ We design and promote a diverse range \nof educational programs to promote youth employability, such˜as \nYouthCan!

Due to COVID-19, we had to innovate in order \nto calculate the contributions of participants. We decided to count \n‚active minutes™ to enable people to safely take part. Participants \naround the world reached all five target milestones in 30 days, \nalmost a month early, contributing to over 25 million active \nminutes.3 The 2020 event provided funding to SOS CVI projects to \ncreate resilience against climate change coupled with COVID-19 \nsupport in Rwanda, Zambia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Nigeria. \n Find out more about the Allianz World Run.\n75\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...investing in mental health services in the U.K.\nAllianz UK has partnered with Mind, the leading mental health \ncharity and their sister charity SAMH (Scottish Association \nfor Mental Health in Scotland) since 2019. The partnership \naims to raise GBP 1 million in three years to fund vital mental \nhealth services. \nThe initiative is raising awareness of the topic of mental \nhealth within Allianz. As a result of the partnership, Allianz has \nimproved the mental well-being support offered to employees \nwhilst promoting a culture of ‚it´s ok not be ok™. 176 mental \nhealth first aiders have been trained to increase support \nacross our British Allianz offices. Employees have taken part in \nfundraising with Allianz committing to match their contribution. \nIn 2020, we reached the milestone of GBP 650,000 raised and \nemployees have continued to fundraise in new and innovative \nways since the impact of COVID-19. Through programs like \nthese, we are playing into the health pillar of our Corporate \nCitizenship Strategy. \nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...working with SOS CVI to support vulnerable \ncommunities in times of disaster\nWe collaborated with SOS CVI as our global disaster relief \npartner with funding to provide immediate relief and long-term \nsupport to vulnerable communities and families on the ground \nand during the COVID-19 crisis. We provided vulnerable \nfamilies in Africa and Indonesia with hygiene materials and \nfood. Other interventions included psychosocial and mental \nhealth support to communities in Italy and income generating \nactivities in Indonesia. Following the explosion in Lebanon \nin August, we supported SOS CVI to carry out immediate \nrelief efforts and long-term care on the ground for vulnerable \nchildren and families. We are also supporting their long-term \nwork in the refugee camp Moria in Greece.\n04.9 Societal impact\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n04.1 Human resources\n   \nDiversity and Inclusion Training and developing our people\n Engaging our employees Health and well-being\n04.2 Data privacy and information security\n Data protection and privacy\n Data ethics\n Information security\n04.3 Regulatory and public affairs\n04.4 Customer satisfaction\n04.5 Compliance\n04.6 Tax transparency\n04.7 Environmental management\n04.8 Sustainable procurement\n04.9 Societal impact\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n06Data and performance\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...getting young people moving in Turkey \nLaunched in 2018, Allianz Motto Movement supports \nchildren aged 7Œ12 years to develop and be healthy through \nmovement and sports. 82 Allianz employees and agencies \nhave volunteered to help deliver the 16-week training program \nand events at public festivals.

Our priorities are exiting coal-based business models \nby 2040 at the latest, implementing the TCFD recommendations \nand˜enhancing our systematic approach to investee engagement \nand policy advocacy. \n1.   \nThe United Nations (U.N.) launched the Net-Zero Asset \nOwner Alliance (AOA) at the Climate Action Summit in New \nYork in September 2019. It consists of the world™s largest \npension funds and insurers who are committed to reduce \nGHG emissions of their investment portfolios to net-zero by \n2050. Allianz helped to set up the group, collaborating with \nthe United Nations Environment Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), \nthe Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), WWF and \nthe Mission 2020 campaign. We currently chair the AOA and \nco\n-lead several working groups. \n  Read more in section 02.2.\n2.  \nI n 2020, we set targets for decarbonization of both our \noperations as well as our investment portfolio. These targets \nare derived from climate science, the investment-related ones \nare additionally in line with the approach of the AOA.\n  Read more in sections 04.7 and 05.3.3.\n3.    \nFor our listed equity portfolio, we have developed a first \nexploratory version of a dedicated inhouse carbon stress \ntest.

They consist of ESG specialists and \nrepresentatives of relevant local operating entities, global lines and \nGroup functions. Each taskforce is sponsored by senior executives \nfrom different functions and quarterly meetings between sponsors \nensure alignment between the different task forces.\nAdditional bodies and functions within the Group monitor \nand analyze market, technological and regulatory trends and \ndevelopments and share insights with key stakeholders.\n  \nFurther information can be found in the Allianz Group Annual Report 2020.\nInsurance and investment functions\nKey insurance operating entities, our internal asset managers \n(Allianz˜Global Investors and PIMCO), and the investment \nmanagement function, Allianz Investment Management (AIM), have \nwell-established climate and ESG teams, which report to BoM level.\nAt AIM, the Investment Management Board (IMB) oversees \nimplementation of climate and ESG strategy for our proprietary \ninvestment portfolio of • 835 billion\n2.

It steers the uptake of climate-related risks \nand opportunities in our insurance and investment \nbusiness. It is regularly updated and overseen by the \nESG Board.\n05.3.1 Our climate change strategy\nThe Strategy focuses on three areas:\n1. We anticipate the risks of a changing climate by:\nŁ systematically considering climate criteria in insurance and \ninvestment business˚\nŁ no longer financing coal-based business models and no longer \nproviding insurance for neither construction nor operation of \nsingle coal-fired power plants and coal mines˚\nŁ fully phasing out coal-based business models along science-\nderived pathways across proprietary investments and P&amp;C \ninsurance portfolios by 2040, at the latest˚ \nŁ maintaining active dialogue with investee companies on climate \nstrategies˚ and\nŁ improving transparency through climate-related disclosures and \naligning our strategy and reporting along the recommendations \nof the G20 Financial Stability Board™s Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n2. We care for the climate-vulnerable by:\nŁ supporting our customers to reduce risks and minimize damage \nand compensating those who have suffered losses˚\nŁ working with peers, governments and the civil society to manage \nclimate risks and ‚close the protection gap™˚ and\nŁ supporting scientific research and innovation that improves \nsociety™s understanding of climate-related risks.\n3. We enable the low-carbon transition by:\nŁ pioneering insurance of low-carbon technologies and, for instance, \ninsuring renewables in more than 60 countries˚\nŁ strategically investing in low-carbon assets, including renewable \nenergy, green buildings, and green bonds˚\nŁ setting long-term and intermediate climate goals for our \nproprietary investments and business operations, in line with \n‚1.5°C-aligned net-zero emission by 2050™ pathways˚ \nŁ joining forces with other asset owners through the U.N.-convened \nNet-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA) to collaboratively support \ncompanies in their low-carbon transition˚ and\nŁ engaging with policymakers to drive sustainable finance and \nachieve the Paris Agreement™s goals.\n  \nSee section 02.2 of our Group Sustainability Report 2020.\n05.3.2 Climate-related risks \nand˛opportunities\nThere is no doubt that climate change will materially affect \neconomies and Allianz™s lines of business. The risks and opportunities \nemerging today will increase over mid- and long-term. \nThey include acute and chronic physical impacts on property and \nhuman health, such as warming temperatures, extreme weather \nevents, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves, droughts and \npotential changes in vector-borne diseases. Risks and opportunities \nalso result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming \nfrom the transition towards a low-carbon economy. These include \nthe impacts of changes in climate policy, technology and market \nsentiment on the market value of financial assets, as well as resulting from climate change litigation.\n83\n05.3 Strategy\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n   Climate-related risks and opportunities\n Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\nImpact on our business and impact of our˛business\nAllianz Group is exposed to risks that are influenced by climate \nchange in a multitude of ways. We are particularly impacted in two \nprinciple ways, both of which can influence the ability of assets to \ngenerate long-term value: \nŁ As an insurer providing insurance policies, e.g. covering health \nimpacts, property damage, or litigation claims and secondly \nthrough changes in the sectors and business models it underwrites. \nŁ As a large-scale institutional investor with significant stakes in \neconomies, companies, infrastructure and real estate that are, or \nwill be, affected by the physical impact of climate change and by \nthe transition to a low-carbon economy. \nThe largest risks in our risk profile are market risks, especially equity \nrisk, credit and credit spread risks driven by assets backing long-\nterm liabilities. Property &amp; Casualty premium and reserve risks \nresulting from natural and man-made catastrophes as well as from \nclaims uncertainty need to be considered. \nAs well as being impacted by climate change, the choices Allianz \nmakes about how to conduct its business may impact climate \nchange, e.g. by investing in or insuring low-carbon and emission-\nreducing activities. To manage potentially detrimental impacts, \nwe˜have committed to align our proprietary investment portfolio to \n1.5°C climate scenarios. \nThe following provides an illustration of how climate change risks \ntranslate into financial impact for investments, applicable to short-\nterm as well as longer-term developments.\nExemplary Illustration of Climate Risks Translation for Investors\nClimate-related changes\nOperating asset impacts\nRisk category\nImpact on\nMitigating  layer on company/\n physical asset level\nFirst order\nSecond order\nImpact \non investor\nPhysical\nAcute\nFirst-order \nhazard/risk\nLike extreme \nweather, \nheat stress, \netc.Second-\norder risk\nLike soil \nmoisture \ndeficit, \ncoastal \nerosion etc.\nŁ Operations\nŁ Value chain\nŁ Markets\nAdaptive capacity \n of companies\n(diversified value chain, \nsubstitutes, sufficient \nstock, insurance, capex, \nefficiencies, etc.)\nImpact on \n corporate \nperformance\nImpact on \n financial asset \nperformance\nŁ  Direct\n in \ncase of \nreal-asset \ninvestments\nŁ  Indirect\n in case of \nlisted equity, \ncorporate \nbonds, \ngovernment \nbonds, \nfunds, etc.Ł  Indirect\n in case of \nmacro-\neconomic/\nsectoral \nimplications\nChronic\nFirst-order \nhazard/risk\nLike \nchanging \ntemperature \npatterns or \nrising sea \nlevels, etc.\nTransition\nPolicy and legalTechnology\nMarket\nReputation\nLitigationLitigation for (enabling) GHG/emissions/\n failure to mitigate, etc.\nLitigation for insufficient disclosure, \nadaptation, etc.84\n05.3 Strategy\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n   Climate-related risks and opportunities\n Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\nGlobal\n2ºC1.5ºC˜˚˜˚˜˚˜ˆˆ\n˜˚˙˚˜˚˜˚˜˚˜ˆˆ\n˜˚˙˚Energy\nIntegrated oil and gas\n(M)(M)(M)TEnergy\nOil and gas storage and transportation\nEnergy\nCoal and consumable fuels\nT, P\nT, P\nT, P\nT, P\nMaterialsFertilizers and agricultural chemicals\n(T)(T)(T)(T)(T)(T)(T)(T)PMaterialsAluminium\nMaterialsSteelIndustrialsIndustrial conglomerates\nIndustrialsAirlines(T)P(T)PConsumer discretionary\nAuto components\nConsumer discretionary\nAutomobiles\nPP, T\nTPPP, T\nP, T\nUtilitiesElectric utilitiesP(M)PPP(M)PPUtilitiesRenewable electricity\nTTTTRisk enhancer:\nRisk mitigator:Risk:P = policy\n(P) = policy\nLowT = substitution technology\n(T) = little substitution technology\nMediumM = related market forces\n(M) = countering market forces\nHighVery high\nFinancial impact of climate change on \nour˛investments\nInternal analysis shows that our proprietary investment portfolio, \nand especially the listed equity asset class, is most sensitive to \nclimate transition scenarios. This is mainly due to the fact that equity \ninvestments are directly affected by climate-related impacts and \nchanging market expectations and resulting market valuation. \nIn contrast, for a long-term investor like Allianz, impacts on debt \ninvestments would be felt first by a changing of spreads and to a \nlesser extent by impairment of debt service of assets. \nDue to this finding, we have further analyzed our risk exposure \nthrough macroeconomic research and a dedicated first carbon \nstress test. With that we combine complementary top-down \nwith bottom-up approaches. (see section 05.4 for carbon stress-\ntest results). \nAllianz Research calculated the macroeconomic negative impact of \nincreasing regulatory intensity on the global industry at nearly 2.5 trillion \nU.S. dollars over the next ten years, while identifying opportunities for a \nvariety of sectors. The analysis focused on the most important measures \nof climate policy currently enacted or under discussion.\nThese measures can be grouped into the following categories: carbon \npricing, energy mix and efficiency mandates, mobility regulations, \nindustry-specific taxes, fines and levies. Cost and business ramifications \nare considered in a contained manner. They depend on emissions™ \ncosts, regulation and policy dynamics. The ultimate risk is a complete \nloss of value of certain assets or entire businesses.\nAccording to report findings, the energy sector will be hit the \nhardest with an estimated cost of 900 billion U.S. dollars. The˜steel \nsector follows with a cost of 300 billion U.S. dollars. Air and marine \ntransport faces costs of 55 billion U.S. dollars. Other sectors at \nrisk include automotive, chemicals, pulp and paper, retail and \nmachinery/manufacturing.\nThe report also presents a heat map, showing transition risk severity \nfor the next twenty years, as well as drivers and mitigating factors \nfor the different sub-sectors. An extract of the results is shown below.\nThe findings of this macroeconomic analysis have also been \nused for internal analysis, for example on the proprietary \ninvestment portfolio.\nAssets and business impact under transition scenarios (source: Allianz, excerpt)\n85\n05.3 Strategy\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n   Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\n05.3.3 Our response\nWe embed the management of risks and opportunities \nresulting from climate change in our overall business strategy. \nMeasures˜include: developing and adjusting financial products \nand servicesˆ updating policies and processesˆ setting targets and \nlimitsˆ managing our operational climate footprintˆ and engaging \nwith˜internal and external stakeholders.\nLong-term ambition and the Asset Owner Alliance\nAs a major outcome of incorporating the assessment of climate-related \nrisks and opportunities into our business strategy, we committed to set \nlong-term emissions reduction targets for our proprietary investment \nportfolio and our business operations. To˜this end, we joined the \nScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in˜ May 2018.\nAfter the release of the landmark Special Report on Global \nWarming of 1.5°C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) in October 2018, we thoroughly reviewed the \nimplications for our corporate response. As a result, we increased \nour ambition from ‚well below 2°C™ and are committed to pursuing \nefforts to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C by the end \nof the century, postulated as the upper ambition level of the Paris \nAgreement as well as the European Union™s long-term climate \nstrategy. We updated our target ambition to 1.5°C-compatible \npathways for carbon reductions and adjusted the coal phase-\nout accordingly.\nIn 2019, Allianz helped to set up the U.N.-convened Net-Zero \nAOA, together with the UNEP FI, the PRI, WWF and the Mission \n2020 campaign. Allianz chairs the AOA and leads several working \ngroups. At the end of 2020, it consisted of 33 asset owners \nmanaging assets of more than five trillion U.S. dollars.\nMembers of the AOA commit to reduce GHG emissions of their \nproprietary investment portfolios to net-zero by 2050. Asset owners \nare already engaging portfolio companies and have committed \nto set intermediary targets for the years 2025, 2030 and beyond to \nensure their portfolios decarbonize in a timely manner. The AOA \nwill report publicly and to the U.N. Secretary General on progress \nagainst these targets.\nThe AOA intends to use state-of-the-art tools and aligns with other \ninitiatives to emphasize:\nŁ Investor ambition and target-setting at portfolio-level˚\nŁ Contribution to methodologies which can be applied across \nthe sector. In 2020, the AOA has developed and publicly \nconsulted its Inaugural Target-Setting Protocol. Furthermore, \nthe AOA has developed principles for methods to measure \ntemperature alignment˚\nŁ Impact on the real economy and emissions Œ to the extent to \nwhich methodologies for measurement can be developed˚\nŁ Implementation via a holistic ESG approach for measuring and \nmanaging associated impacts˚ and\nŁ Joint engagement and monitoring based on authoritative and \ncredible scientific input, to ensure consistency of messaging and \nnecessary ambition.\nMembers have committed to carry out and disclose portfolio \nbaseline assessments and develop climate strategies and action \nplans, including trajectories. Members are already collaborating to \ndefine best practices to reduce GHG emissions by engaging with \nportfolio companies and governments on public policies. The first \nquantitative joint AOA report will be published by December 2023.\nAs part of the long-term commitment to have net-zero greenhouse \ngas emissions by 2050, we have set our first intermediate target: \nWe˜will reduce the GHG emissions from our listed equity and \ncorporate bonds portfolios by -25 percent by 2024 (compared to \n2019). More targets are explained in detail in section 05.6.1).\nManaging transition risks\nWe have conducted detailed analysis of energy-intensive sectors™ \nemission profiles, possible proto typical-decarbonization pathways \nand necessary technology shifts. The results are used for portfolio \ncarbon analysis to define decarbonization pathways and to inform \nour corporate engagement process and management decisions.\nIn previous years, we ran pilot portfolios on climate-related \ntarget-setting and steering which allowed us to identify data \ngaps, derive˜monitoring and steering approaches and metrics, \nand˜identify potential investment management actions. Building \non these insights, we have been developing ways to monitor and \nsteer the portfolio transition as part of the AOA. Allianz Investment \nManagement is also working to close data gaps by sourcing own \ndata directly from investee companies.\nAllianz has not financed coal-based business models since 2015. \nEquity stakes have been divested, fixed income investments made \nbefore that have been put in run-off, and no new investments have \nbeen allowed since 2015. We do not offer insurance for coal power \nplants or mines and we require all companies across our Property \n&amp; Casualty (P&amp;C) insurance and proprietary investment portfolio \nto fully phase out coal by 2040 at the latest. If companies do not \npresent a credible strategy to transition away from coal at a pace \nwhich is compatible with the scientific pathways of limiting global \nwarming to 1.5°C, we exclude them from our business.\n  \nOur criteria are being continuously tightened and explained in more detail in \nour public Statement on Coal-based Business Models.\n86\n05.3 Strategy\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n   Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\nSeizing on opportunities\nOur business strategy includes systematically leveraging \nopportunities for financing a low-carbon and climate-resilient \nfuture, e.g. by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency \nin˜real estate and electric vehicle infrastructure and by providing \ninsurance solutions to protect against physical climate impacts \nand˜support low-carbon business models. \nFor proprietary investments, the Allianz ESG Functional Rule \nfor Investments provides the foundation of integrating climate-\nrelated issues. It comprises asset manager selection and systematic \nintegration of climate and ESG factors into our investment decisions.\n Read more in our ESG Integration Framework.\nWe have strategically invested in low-carbon assets for over a \ndecade. This includes renewable energy, certified green buildings \nand green bonds (see also the section 05.6 Metrics). \nOur Sustainable Solutions program provides products and services \nthat create shared value by improving people™s lives and/or \ndelivering a positive environmental impact.\nAllianz is one of the leading insurers of low-carbon technologies. \nAs part of our Sustainable Solutions approach, we provide \nstandardized and tailor-made insurance products and are insuring \nrenewables in more than 60 countries.\nIn 2019, we started analyzing technological and natural negative-\nemission solutions to accompany our net-zero commitment. In 2020, \nwe developed the first respective investment strategies and are \nco\n-leading the Asset Owner Alliance working group which works \non˜the financing of the transition.\nWe also aim to reduce the impacts of climate risks and incentivize \npreventive measures to increase customers™ resilience and \ncompensate for climate-related damages. Examples include Risk \nConsulting services offered by AGCS, our active support of the \nInsuResilience Global Partnership, or our work with the German \nCorporation for International Corporation (GIZ) to pilot innovative \ninsurance solutions in emerging and developing countries.\n  \nFor more details on these and other examples, please see sections 03.1 \nand˜03.2 in our Group Sustainability Report 2020.\nActive company dialogue, joining forces and \ntargeted engagement\nWe actively engage investee companies and insurance clients using \na variety of channels and formats. Besides the Group CR function, \nAIM also has a dedicated engagement function for proprietary \ninvestments. In addition, our internal asset managers Œ AllianzGI \nand PIMCO Œ and our industrial insurer Allianz Global Corporate \n&amp;˜Specialty are active stewards on climate-related matters.\nAllianz™s shareholder voting rights are exercised by AllianzGI. \nAllianzGI conducts voting activities in line with Global Corporate \nGovernance Guidelines and generally supports proposals that \nencourage company boards and management to increase \ntransparency on and consideration of sustainability issues \ndeemed material to the long-term performance of the company. \nAllianzGI votes and engages on behalf of Allianz SE and all \nother asset management clients, and thus considers all clients \nin˜their approach.\nBy leveraging the expertise of several units and departments, \nwe aim to create an impact in the real economy and encourage \ncompanies to define and implement science-based climate \nstrategies. By actively encouraging companies to set and pursue \ntransparent and measurable climate targets, for example by \njoining the SBTi, we have the opportunity to reduce emissions \nin˜our˜proprietary investment portfolio and in the real world. \nIn 2020, we joined a call by 137 investors with 20 trillion U.S. dollars \nassets under management asking over 1,800 companies to commit \nto climate action in line with 1.5°C and a net-zero future by setting \nscience-based targets. \n  \nRead here for more details.\n  \nFor more details on our engagement approach please see section 03.2 \nin˜our˜Group Sustainability Report 2020. \n  \nFor voting records of AllianzGI, please˜refer to their overview web page.\nWe are joining forces with other asset owners in encouraging \ncompanies to implement such pathways. Our participation in \nthe Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), the engagement platform \nClimate Action 100+ and the Principles for Responsible Investment \n(PRI) connects us with like-minded investors and offers platforms \nfor collaborative engagement. On decarbonization matters, the \nAOA strives to be the hinge between these existing engagement \nplatforms, asset owners, target verification initiatives and tools \nand policymakers.\n87\nCollaborating for a sustainable future–\n ...by actively engaging oil and gas sector companies\nIn the past year, we engaged oil and gas companies on the topic \nof climate disclosure, selecting a target group of investees from our \nportfolio that were not sufficiently reporting in line with TCFD and \nnot an official TCFD supporter. By focusing our engagement on \nthis target group, we were able to use our engagement to address \nthree risks at once: 1) high-concern target group˚ 2) hard-to-abate \nsector where all participants need to be moving˚ and 3) supporting \na reporting framework that we have high confidence in. \nWe had a strong response rate and companies engaged with \nthe suggested TCFD disclosures that are considered relevant \nfor this sector. Many companies were considering, or are now \nconsidering, reporting in line with TCFD requirements and our \ndetailed suggestions helped guide them on what large institutional \ninvestors want to see in their disclosures. Several companies did \nnot realize that they could become official TCFD supporters and \nhave subsequently been added to the TCFD web page. We will be \nmonitoring for improvements in their disclosures and following up \nwith those that have not met our request.\n In alignment with Climate Action 100+, we are leading one long-\nterm engagement and participating in three more engagements \nwith oil and gas companies. Participating in Climate Action 100+ is \none of the most effective and well accepted forms of engagement \nby large industry actors because the quality of discussions \nincreases with both sides being able to offer significantly more \nresources, than if all collaborators were to approach a company \nindividually. Participation and involvement in engagements \nis high and correlates to some of the most well-known and \npublic outcomes between large industry emitters and investor \nengagement. We˜have seen increased alignment with TCFD \nreporting, shareholder resolutions being prepared for 2020 proxy \nseason, and˜development of net-zero commitments by oil and gas \ncompanies in˜scope of the engagement.\n For further information please see section 03.2.\n05.3 Strategy\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n   Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\n88\nAligning our own business operations to net-zero\nBesides driving decarbonization through our insurance and \ninvestment business, we continually work to improve the \nenvironmental performance of our own operations through \ndialogue and engagement. \nIn 2020, we defined new emission-reduction targets for our business. \nHaving over-achieved our previous targets by 12 percentage points \n(target: 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 vs. 2010) we have \ncommitted to reduce our GHG emissions a further 30 percent by \n2025, against a baseline of 2019.\nWe met the 2020 target mainly through energy efficiency \nimprovements from data center consolidation and the increase in \nthe share of renewable power in our energy mix. The target was \nfurther exceeded as a result of reduced business travel and an \nincrease in work-from-home measures due to the pandemic.\nIn operationalizing our commitment through the RE100 initiative to \nsource 100 percent renewable power for our group-wide operations \nby 2023, we have started to engage deeply with our suppliers \nand landlords and to collaborate with peers and the RE100 \ninitiative to achieve this target. In 2020, 57 percent of our electricity \nconsumption was renewable electricity. \nOur long-established carbon reduction strategy to manage \nemissions from our operations includes exchange and engagement \nwith service providers, suppliers and employees and adjusting \ninternal processes and policies. We require all vendors in our supply \nchain above a certain spend threshold to meet the standards of the \nAllianz Code of Conduct and include environmental and climate \nissues in a vendor screening.\n  \nFor further information on our environmental management, including˜trends \ninfluencing our performance, please see section 04.7 in our Group \nSustainability Report 2020.\n05.3 Strategy\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n   Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\nForest protection to protect carbon sinks \nand˛biodiversity \nIn 2019, we committed to pursue efforts to limit global warming \nto a maximum of 1.5°C by the end of the century and aim for net-\nzero emissions by 2050. To date, we have claimed our operations \nto be ‚carbon-neutral™ since 2012. We˜achieved this through our \ninvestments in the protection of existing rainforests (Wildlife Works \nCarbon and Rimba Raya), thereby maintaining significant carbon \nsinks. This created voluntary emission certificates which we used to \noffset our operational emissions. The protection of natural systems \nis essential to achieve climate goals and even more important \nthan planting new trees. Those˜take much longer amounts of time \nto store similar amounts of carbon. In the specific case of Rimba \nRaya, for instance, the Indonesian government had designated \nlarge areas on which palm oil plantations were to be established \nbefore Allianz invested in the protection of the existing swamp \nforest in 2013. \n  \nFor more information read here.\nIn addition to this benefit, those projects also empower the \nlocal population through job creation, provision of health \ncare and education Œ whilst simultaneously preserving \nbiodiversity. Looking ahead, we believe focus should be both \non reducing emissions in line with science and protecting \nnatural systems. Therefore, we now have set corresponding \ntargets to reduce emissions in our investments and operations. \nFurthermore, the˜IPCC defines carbon neutrality as ‚achieved \nwhen anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the \natmosphere are balanced by anthropogenic removals over a \nspecified period™\n1. We˜support this understanding of carbon \nneutrality. Science has made clear that the 1.5°C target will \nrequire an upscaled removal of emissions from the atmosphere \ninto technical and natural carbon sinks. In this context, we˜will \nreview our approach to retiring carbon offsets and we are \nlooking to scale removals as well to achieve our net-zero \nemissions goals. \n1    \nSource: IPCC, 2018: Annex I: Glossary.

Without˜decisive \naction by governments, there will be insufficient market incentives \nto allocate capital in line with a 1.5°C-trajectory. The private sector, \nincluding insurers, can play an important part in˜raising government \nawareness and making the business case for getting back on track \nwith the Paris Agreement. \nAsset owners like Allianz are in a unique position in the financing \nvalue chain, especially those setting themselves portfolio targets \nand therefore being dependent on change in policy and the real \neconomy to achieve them. \nIn 2020, we made it a priority to advocate for a green recovery to \nbuild back better after the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the \nrecovery, government spending and recovery packages are playing \na pivotal role in underpinning economies, infrastructures, jobs and \nlivelihoods.

We use \nregular stress-tests and additional climate-related \nscenario analyses to inform our strategic decisions \nas˜well as individual transactions. \nWe perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons \nup to 2050 and including scenarios ranging from 1.5°C to 4°C \nof average warming by the end of the century. We make use of \ninternal models as well as external tools. While material time \nhorizons naturally differ depending on the lines of business under \nconsideration, the range of scenarios we apply allows us to better \nassess the variety of risks and opportunities associated with \nclimate change. 1  \nThe scenario analysis and carbon stress test of section 05.4 is not yet part of the assurance \nscope, as this section pertains to various assumptions and forward looking information. Methods \nto provide assurance on such analyses are currently under development internationally. \n Please˜also see the cautionary note on forward-looking statements on page 133.\n2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n3 Network for Greening the Financial System.\n4 Inevitable Policy Response.\n5 International Energy Agency.\n6 International Renewable Energy Agency.\nWe have called on the International Energy Agency\n already \ntwice to develop and make available a full scenario aligned \nwith 1.5°C and net-zero emissions by 2050. While the IEA™s most \nrecent World Energy Outlook included a partial 1.5°C scenario, \nit stopped short of providing an outlook beyond 2030 and all \nunderlying data tables as for the other scenarios.\nWe aim to use a number of different scenario providers and \nscenarios for our analyses to reflect the range of potential future \ndevelopments and reduce the sensitivity to individual scenario \nnarratives and assumptions. To this end, it has proved useful to \nhave access to an increasing number of scenarios in general and \nespecially those aligned with 1.5°C pathways.\nWhen we conduct analyses which assess scenario alignment, \nwe˜adjust our scenario selection using guidance developed by the \nAOA which is focused on 1.5°C scenarios with no or low emission \novershoot. When conducting outside-in impact scenario analysis, \nwe use a broader range of scenarios in terms of temperature \noutcomes. For physical risks we are applying RCP 4.5 and 8.5 for \nour analyses and aim to incorporate RCP 6.0 in the future as well. \nFor˜transition risks we are using, amongst others, IPCC™s SR15 and \nAR5 scenarios, IEA™s SDS, NZE2050, 2DS and B2DS scenarios, and \nthe NGFS scenarios released in 2020.\nWe apply scenarios, for instance, in analyzing decarbonization \nchallenges and pathways of sectors and assets, potential stranded \nassets and technology developments across different sectors. \nOn˜physical risks, we seek to identify potential impacts on physical \nassets we insure, own, or operate, as well as impacts on client \nor investee level and associated portfolios. This type of analysis \nis being used for both sides of the balance sheet as well as our \noperations including procurement. We also use scenario data and \nanalysis to develop forward-looking criteria for our investment \ndecisions with regard to carbon-intensive business models and low-\ncarbon opportunities.\nCarbon Stress Test\nThis year, we publish for the first time results of an approach to \nmodelling carbon risks for our listed equity portfolio with a bottom-up \napproach. It shall complement top-down approaches such as those \nput forward by financial markets regulators. We see merit in a model \nwhich gives us full transparency on methods and parameters, is easy \nto implement and gives a first understanding of evolution of potential \nclimate impact on portfolio. It further gives possibility to cross-\ncheck external methodologies and provides a basis for potential \ndevelopment of more elaborate models going forward. \nMethods, assumptions and parameters\nThe approach uses effective carbon prices as a proxy for policy \nintensity, e.g. actual carbon pricing, energy-related subsidies and \nincentives, standards for energy efficiency and emissions.\nThe fundamental idea is that an increase in emissions price \nentails a decrease in earnings at the level of individual investee \ncompanies. The decrease in earnings can be translated into a stock \nmarket value loss based on price-to-earnings multiples. The model \nrequires assumptions on e.g. cost pass-through, price elasticities, or \nregulatory easing (either explicitly or implicitly via effective carbon \nprices) which are kept simple for this first version and need to be \nrefined further. \nThe starting point is the carbon footprint of the listed equity \nportfolio, as disclosed in section 05.6, using scope 1 and 2 emission \nfigures. On˜this we apply carbon price shocks derived from the \nclimate scenarios developed in the Network for Greening the \nFinancial System. \n  \nRead more on the Network for Greening the Financial System here.\nIn the scenarios, these prices materialize over the coming ten years \nand are depending significantly on intensity of policy action and \nunderlying scenario assumptions. Carbon prices projected for 2030 \nrange from • 45 to 115 per tonne CO\n2e in 2°C-aligned scenarios, \nand increase to • 95 to 374 per tonne CO\n2e in 1.5°C-aligned \nscenarios. The model assumes instantaneous changes of effective \ncarbon prices applied to the portfolio, with no mitigation actions. \nTypical time horizons\nShort-term\nMedium-term Long-term\n up to three years\nAs defined, for \ninstance, in our \nstandard Top\n Risk Assessment process.\nthree Œ ten years\nNeeded for \nestablishing solvency \nconsiderations and \ncapital adequacy.\nten+ yearsAs, for instance, required \nfor strategic decisions and \ntransactions with investment \nhorizons of several decades like \nreal estate and infrastructure.\nWe rely on our own and third-party scenarios provided by renown \ninstitutions and initiatives such as the IPCC\n2, NGFS3, IPR4, the institutions \nbehind the E.U. long-term scenarios, the IEA\n5 or˜IRENA6.91\n05.4 Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\nLimitationsTo re-emphasize, this is a first version, it focuses on listed equity impacts \nonly and also does not yet account for factors like different physical \nasset bases and resulting lock-ins, cost pass-through abilities, price \nelasticities or regulatory relief. It also does not yet differentiate between \nscope 1 and 2 emissions and, importantly, it assumes companies \ndo not respond to climate policy trends, e.g. governmental net-zero \nstrategies, by lowering their carbon exposure. These are factors which \ncan become part of more elaborated versions. In addition, we also aim \nto develop our approach further to cover additional large asset classes \nlike corporate bonds or real estate.\nResults and interpretation\nIt is noteworthy that there is certain carbon concentration in our listed \nequity portfolio, with ten issuers accounting for about 40˜percent of \nowned absolute emissions. Also on sector level, 94 percent of owned \nemissions are concentrated in five sectors\n1, accounting for around 60 \npercent of AuM, as disclosed in section 05.6.\nConsistent with analysis disclosed in previous years and with the \nscoping of this approach, our listed equity portfolio shows Œ within the \ncurrent modeling framework and its limitations Œ sensitivities in those \nsectors and companies. The overall sensitivity stays contained in the \nImmediate 2°C scenario with CDR\n2, with market value losses between \n-4 percent to -8 percent depending on climate-economic model. \nWhen more emission reductions are required and also atmospheric \ncarbon removal is a limited option as in the Immediate 1.5°C scenario \nwith limited CDR, the impact increases significantly: market value \nlosses go up to -12 percent to -19 percent. From FY19 to FY20, the \nnumbers have decreased as our equity portfolio carbon footprint was \nreduced, see section 05.6.\nBeing aware of the limitations of our approach, the results are \nstill leading us to the right follow-up questions to understand \nhow carbon price increases can affect different sectors and which \nparameters of individual investee companies will lead to a non-\nuniform development inside a given sector as not all will be affected \nequally. This holds especially true as major carbon emitters are often \nexempted from carbon pricing schemes due to carbon leakage risks. \nOur strategic response to carbon risks is our long-term commitment \nto and our intermediary portfolio targets made as part of the UN-\nconvened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA), the members \nof which are committed to ‚transitioning investment portfolios \nto net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 consistent with a maximum \ntemperature rise of 1.5C degrees above pre-industrial temperatures™ \n(see chapters 05.3.3 on the AOA and 05.6.1 on AOA-related \ntargets). The work of the Alliance is done in collaboration and with \na collective ambition, bringing together global investors, leading \ncivil society and academia organizations, and the leadership of the \nUN.

One of the \nmain barriers they face is trusted data as well as transparent \nanalytic tools to quantify and act decisively on climate-\nrelated risk and opportunities. Methodologies remain not \nstandardized enough and the market for data and tools is \nhighly fragmented. \nTherefore, Allianz is supporting and contributing to Open \nSource Climate (OS-C), an initiative hosted under the Linux \nFoundation, to build together with like-minded companies a \n‚pre-competitive laye™ of modeling and data that is globally \nshared and accessible Œ and which will accelerate innovation. \nOS-C links company data, climate analytics (scenarios and \nstress-tests) and scientific climate models in one platform, \nallowing for global collaboration on this exceptional \ndata challenge.Allianz is heavily involved in the development of the prototype \ntogether with other large corporations like Amazon, Microsoft and \nGoldman Sachs.Further examples of the application of scenario analysis include:\nŁ Prospect and existing infrastructure assets undergo a thorough \ndiligence along evaluation criteria taking into account an asset™s \nGHG emissions and potential impact on capital expenditures and \nperformance.

They are responsible for the risks taken and the \nreturns from their decisions. \nŁ The ‚Second Line of Defense™ consists of independent global \noversight functions. These are Risk, Actuarial, Compliance \nand Legal, which support the Group Board of Management \nin defining the risk frameworks within which the business \ncan operate. \nŁ Group Audit forms the ‚Third Line of Defense™, independently \nand regularly reviewing risk governance implementation and \ncompliance with risk principles, performing quality reviews of risk \nprocesses, and testing adherence to business standards, including \nthe internal control framework.\nEarly warning indicators are monitored and regularly reported \nto senior management through risk dashboards, risk capital \nallocation and limit consumption reports to identify when climate \naspects become material. Supplemented by quarterly updates, \nsenior management decides the risk management strategy and \nrelated actions.\nA key tool is the Allianz Risk Capital Model which assesses natural \ncatastrophe events for the upcoming year on subsidiary and \nGroup level. \nAnother important instrument is the yearly Top Risk Assessment \nwhich helps to identify and remediate significant threats to financial \nresults, operational viability, reputation and delivery of strategic \nobjectives, regardless of whether they can be quantified or not. \nThis˜includes immediate risks for the company and emerging \nrisks, which may arise from technological developments, new or \nchanging environmental risks and socio-demographic changes. \nClimate-related factors are included in Top Risk Assessments \nconducted operating entity and Group level. Relevant emerging \nrisks are discussed by the GFRC or the GUC. Following that, \nunderwriting opportunities or mitigation measures are \nimplemented where necessary.\n  \nFor more details on these risk management processes please see the Risk \nand Opportunity Report on page pages 84Œ100 of the Allianz Group Annual \nReport 2020.\n05.5.2 Natural catastrophe risk governance\nThe group-wide risk management framework is also applicable \nfor natural catastrophes. Each operating entity is responsible for \ncontrolling its exposure to individual catastrophes and defining \nlocal reinsurance requirements, based on local risk appetite and \ncapital position. The respective cover is provided by Allianz SE or \none of its subsidiaries. At Group level, the BoM reviews and approves the risk appetite. \nThe˜reinsurance division is responsible for designing and \nimplementing Group catastrophe protections within given exposure \nlimits. These covers take various forms and aim to protect the Group \nagainst excessive losses from major natural catastrophes.\nWe use special modeling techniques for natural catastrophes which \ncombine portfolio data (e.g. geographic location, characteristics \nof insured objects and their values) with simulated natural disaster \nscenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential \nlosses. Where such models do not exist, we use deterministic, \nscenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses.\nExperts at Allianz Reinsurance Œ including meteorologists, \nhydrologists, geophysicists, geographers and mathematicians Œ \nmodel around 50 natural catastrophe scenarios for Allianz Group, \nwith data captured using best-in-class standards, mapping a range \nof perils and regions. The results provide the basis for group-wide \nrisk monitoring, risk limits and subsequent business decisions. The˜top three perils contributing to natural catastrophe risk for \nAllianz Group in the past four years were: windstorms in Europe, \nfloods in Germany, and earthquakes in Australia. \nWe also conduct selected stress-scenario analysis on natural \ncatastrophe risks like hail or windstorms to be used in risk steering. \nNatural catastrophe models are regularly updated according to \nthe latest scientific information. We are continuously improving \nthe inclusion of global natural catastrophe hazard information, \nincluding climate, into underwriting decisions.05.5.3 Climate and ESG-related \nrisk˛governance\nIn addition to addressing climate-related risks as part of our \noverarching qualitative and quantitative reporting and controlling \nframework, a variety of comprehensive policies and processes foster \nintegration of climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThe Allianz ESG approach integrates climate- and sustainability-\nrelated considerations by applying group-wide corporate rules and \nESG instruments across all underwriting and investment activities. \nThis includes the Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments and \nthe Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk and Issues Management \nwhich establish a core set of principles and processes for the \nmanagement of reputational risks and ESG issues within the Group. \nAll rules and standards are regularly updated to reflect newest \ninsights and external developments. The publicly available third \nedition of the Allianz ESG Integration Framework\n increases \ntransparency around internal processes and guidelines related \nto our ESG approach. We also rely on external providers for data \nrelated to climate, ESG and reputational risks.\n94\nAs an additional layer, the Climate Integration team within \nGlobal Sustainability and the ESG Task Forces ensure the early \nidentification, measurement and business integration of risks and \nopportunities arising from physical climate change and the low-\ncarbon transition. Examples include regulatory activity around \nclimate change and sustainable finance, integration of ESG \nand climate considerations in business processes and dedicated \nprojects. Substantial topics are channeled to the ESG Board to \ninform strategic decision-making.\nRisk and opportunity considerations are supplemented by \nadditional processes, including:\nŁ The annual Allianz Risk Barometer produced by Allianz \nGlobal Corporate &amp; Specialty. It is a survey amongst corporate \nclients, brokers, industry trade organizations, risk consultants, \nunderwriters, senior managers and claims experts, in total \ncollecting more than 2,700 responses from 92 countries and 22 \nindustry sectors. Climate change is ranked ninth and is linked to \nnatural catastrophe risks on sixth position as a key risk to property \nbusiness, but also gains increasing importance in shaping \nemission-intensive industries in terms of transition risks. Business \ninterruption as another overarching topic, with potential triggers \nalso found in climate-related events, ranked highest together with \nthe risks of pandemics.\n   \nRisk Barometer here.\nŁ The Global Claims Review analyzes more than 470,000 claims \nin over 200 countries and territories. The latest Review from \n2019 found windstorms as the only natural catastrophe event to \nappear in the top 10 causes of loss. Natural catastrophes account \nfor five percent of claims in number and 13 percent of total \nvalue of all claims. It represents some of the largest exposures \nto the energy as well as property and engineering segments. \nEnvironmental- and climate change-related liability issues are \nseen to potentially increase in future.\nŁ Our partnership and memberships as described in section 05.3.3 \nalso facilitate early risk detection as well as access to industry \ndiscussions and best practice.\nŁ A regular materiality assessment ranks emerging ESG and \nclimate issues and opportunities according to their importance \nfor our business and our stakeholders. See section 02.5.\nŁ Ongoing regular dialogue with internationally recognized \nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) provides ad hoc \nand scheduled exchanges on sustainability matters. The NGO \ndialogue is a forum for direct exchange of ideas and points \nof view designed to leverage NGO™s expertise on climate and \nESG matters to support the development and implementation \nof internal policies, programs and plans. Allianz listens to the \nconcerns of NGO partners and discusses potential solutions to \naddress these concerns. In 2020, our conversations with NGOs \nmoved to digital formats due to the pandemic. \nŁ Ongoing dialogues with policymakers, regulators and \nacademia on key economic, governmental, environmental and \nsocietal issues, including climate change, to anticipate arising \ndevelopments and share opinions, knowledge and best practice.\nFor proprietary investments, the ESG Functional Rule for Investments \nprovides the foundation of integrating climate-related issues. \nIt˜comprises asset manager selection and systematic integration of \nclimate and ESG factors into our investment decisions. Across˜our \nportfolio, ESG assessment processes and data, including a variety \nof climate and carbon data (see section 05.6.2), enable continuous \nmonitoring and steering of performance at security and˜portfolio level. \nFor listed assets, we use ESG scores and climate indicators \nto manage ESG risks and opportunities in our proprietary \nportfolio. If certain assets score below defined thresholds, further \ninvestigation is mandatory under central monitoring, leading to \na variety of potential measures, including engagement with the \nrespective companies.\n  \nFor more details on our activities as a sustainable insurer and investors, \nsee˜sections 03.1 and 03.2 in our Group Sustainability Report 2020.\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n   Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n95\n05.6\n Metrics and targets\n01Introduction\n02Sustainability strategy\n and governance\n03Sustainability in our core\n business activities04Sustainability in our organization\n05Allianz™s climate-related\n financial disclosure\n05.1 Highlights05.2 Governance\n Overarching and board-level governance\n  \nBusiness and management-\nlevel governance\n  \nBoard remuneration and \nclimate competence\n05.3 Strategy\n Our climate change strategy\n Climate-related risks and opportunities\n Our response\n05.4  \nStrategy resilience, stress-tests and \nclimate scenario analysis\n05.5 Risk and opportunity management\n Overarching risk governance\n Natural catastrophe risk governance\n Climate and ESG related risk governance\n05.6 Metrics and targets\n   Targets and target performance\n Metrics06Data and performance\nOur support for the low-carbon transition is steered \nby our commitment to set science-based emission \nreduction targets and reach net-zero emissions by \n2050 in our business operations and proprietary \ninvestment portfolio in line with the Paris Agreement™s \ntarget of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.\nFurthermore, we are proud of being ranked as leading in key \nsustainability rankings: \n1st rank in Climate Strategy in Dow Jones \nSustainability Index 2020 as well as A- in CDP climate change.\n05.6.1 Targets and target performance\nTargets 2018\nProgress 2018\nTargets 2019\nProgress 2019\nTargets 2020\nProgress 2020\nTargets 2021+\nDecarbonizing\n our investments\nInvestigate further \nalignment of investment \nstrategy with\n a 2ºC target\nCommitted to Science Based \nTargets initiative in May 2018\nSet long-term climate targets for proprietary \ninvestments and business \noperations in line with \nwell below 2ºC\nRun pilot portfolios on \nclimate-related target-\nsetting and steering\nActively contributed to setting \nup U.N.-convened Net-Zero \nAsset Owner Alliance (AOA), \na group of asset owners \ncommitted to reduce the GHG \nemissions of their investment \nportfolios to net-zero by 2050\nRan pilot portfolios on \nclimate-related target-\nsetting and steering, results \nused in operationalization of \nAOA commitment\nRaised our carbon reduction \ntarget ambition to align with \n1.5°C-compatible pathways\nSet long-term and intermediary climate \ntargets (2025) for \nproprietary investments \nin line with 1.5ºC as soon as AOA has \ndefined framework for \ntarget\n-setting \nThereafter, regularly report \non progress and review \ntargets at least every five \nyears in line with Paris \nAgreement Article˜4.9\nReduce GHG emissions \nof proprietary investment \nportfolio to net-zero \nby˜2050Set first intermediate 2025 target as part of our ‚net-zero \nby 2050™ commitment for \nour proprietary investment \nportfolio as well as operations \n(see section ‚environmental \nconcept™ for operational \nemission targets)\nFor our proprietary investment \nportfolio, we aim to reduce \nGHG emissions to net-zero by \n2050.

Enterprise value is \nsourced from Bloomberg.\n2019 figures for listed equity have been restated.

Absolute \nemissions even reduced by over a third. The significantly larger \ncorporate bonds portfolio on the other hand, grew in size by \n2˜percent while reducing the absolute and relative emissions by \n4˜percent and 10 percent respectively. \nSectorally, we are invested with considerable shares of our equity \nand bond portfolios into manufacturing companies. Therefore \nwe also display NACE level 2 sectors to further disaggregate the \nsector figures.\nThe year 2020 showed why we believe that both absolute \nand relative indicators are necessary to measure the carbon \nperformance of portfolios. Relative indicators are sensitive to \nchanges in either direction in both company valuation and \ncompany sales, whereas absolute emissions are sensitive to \nstrategic asset allocation shifts.\nIt should also be noted that our current emission Scope is 1 and \n2 and does not consider emissions in the wider value chain of \ninvestees, which˜can be significant for many sectors. While data \nquality for Scope 3 emissions is still low, we believe there is merit \nin sector-specific Scope 3 indicators and data to determine if \ncompanies and their products are on a pathway consistent with our \n1.5°C ambition. We˜are working to develop these indicators also as \npart of our work with the AOA.

Furthermore, the executive directors \nare responsible for such internal control as they have \nconsidered necessary to enable the preparation of \na Report that is free from material misstatement \nwhether due to fraud or error.\nIndependence and Quality Control of \nthe Audit Firm\nWe have complied with the German professional \nprovisions regarding independence as well as \nother ethical requirements.\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards Œ in \nparticular the Professional Code for German \nPublic Auditors and German Chartered \nAuditors (ﬁBerufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer \nGRIund vereidigte Buchprüferﬁ: ﬁBS WP/vBPﬂ) \nas well as the Standard on Quality Control 1 \npublished by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer \n(Institute of Public Auditors in Germany˚ IDW): \nRequirements to quality control for audit \nfirms (IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: \nAnforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in \nder Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis Œ IDW QS 1) Œ and \naccordingly maintains a comprehensive system \nof quality control including documented policies \nand procedures regarding compliance with \nethical requirements, professional standards and \napplicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nPractitioner™s Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance \nconclusion on the disclosures in the Report based on \nthe assurance engagement we have performed. \nWithin the scope of our engagement we did not \nperform any procedures on external sources of \ninformation or expert opinions, referred to in \nthe Report.\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in \naccordance with the International Standard on \nAssurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \nAssurance Engagements other than Audits or \nReviews of Historical Financial Information, \nissued˜by the IAASB.

The assurance procedures selected \ndepend on the practitioner™s judgment.\nWithin the scope of our assurance engagement, \nwe performed amongst others the following \nassurance procedures and further activities:\nŁ Obtaining an understanding of the structure \nof the sustainability organization and of the \nstakeholder engagement.\nŁ Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation \nof the Report regarding the preparation process, \nthe internal control system relating to this process \nand selected disclosures in the Report.\nŁ Inspection of processes for collecting, controlling, \nanalyzing and aggregating selected data at \nspecific sites of the Company. \nŁ Identification of the likely risks of material \nmisstatement of the Report under consideration \nof the GRI-Criteria.\nŁ Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in \nthe Report.\nŁ Comparison of selected disclosures with \ncorresponding data in the consolidated \nfinancial statements and in the management report.\nŁ Evaluation of the presentation of the selected \ndisclosures regarding sustainability performance.\nAssurance conclusion\nBased on the assurance procedures performed \nand assurance evidence obtained, nothing has \ncome to our attention that causes us to believe \nthat the disclosures in the Company™s Report for \nthe period from 1 January to 31 December 2020 \nhave not been prepared, in all material aspects, \nin accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria.\nIntended Use of the Assurance Report\nWe issue this report on the basis of the \nengagement agreed with the Company. \nThe˜assurance engagement has been performed \nfor purposes of the Company and the report \nis solely intended to inform the Company as \nto the results of the assurance engagement. \nThe˜report is not intended to provide third parties \nwith support in making (financial) decisions. \nOur˜responsibility lies solely toward the Company. \nWe do not assume any responsibility towards \nthird parties.\nMunich, 28 April 2021PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\nHendrik Fink   \nppa.

We as an \nindustrial company, are being called upon to develop intel\n-ligent \nconcepts that can Œ sensibly, deliberately and not \nhastily Œ \ntransform the way business is currently done into \na sustainable system of doing business, without destabi\n-lizing the current economic system or harming competitive \ncapability. This is a complex, multi-dimensional question \n\nwhich politics and business must solve together without \n\nfalling into ineffective actionism.\nAt \nFUCHS\n, we have long dedicated ourselves to these \nproblems in order to play our part together with our indus\n-try partners. In the realm of sustainability, \nFUCHS\n is taking \naction in three core areas:\n\nWorking systemically in industry and with associations \nto make sustainability measurable and veri˜able, based on \nnew industry standards yet to be developed. This is the \n\nonly way that sensible, systemic decisions are possible.\n\nProjects that quantify the various elements of sustain\n-ability Œ in particular carbon footprint in terms of the \nﬁsupplier Œ in-house production Œ ˜nished product life\n-cycleﬂ triangle Œ and make them veri˜able in order to \n\nachieve improvements in targeted projects.\nDr. Lutz Lindemann, \nMember of the Executive Board \nCTO\n\nSocial engagement in the communities in which our \ncompanies operate through ˜nancial support for social \nprojects, combined with the personal involvement of our \nemployees.

The Executive Board member \ndirectly responsible is the Chief Technology Of˜cer (\nCTO\n). \nThe Executive Board de˜nes the strategic framework for \n\nsustainability in close cooperation with the Group™s Sus\n-tainability division headed by the Vice President for Sus\n-tainability.\nIn cooperation with the global function heads, who meet \ntwo to three times a year as the \nFUCHS\n Sustainability \nCommittee, the local sustainability of˜cers of the \n33 national units with production operations, the Executive \nBoard and, increasingly, the sales units to map sustainabil\n-ity efforts along the entire supply chain, the Sustainability \n\ndivision bundles the respective requirements and designs \nFUCHS\n™ central sustainability strategy on this basis.\nThe local sustainability of˜cers (\nLSO\n) are the connecting \nlinks between the Group company in Mannheim and the \n\nnational units with production operations. They are the \non-site and ˜rst points of contact for questionnaires as \nwell as for the local implementation of the sustainability \nstrategy in coordination with the respective management. \nThey also provide stimulus for the central Sustainability \ndepartment.\n2 Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n2.1 Organization\nSustainability organization \nFUCHS Sustainability Committee\nLocal Sustainability Of˜cers\nExecutive Board: Overall responsibility for sustainability\nResponsible Executive Board member: Chief Technology Of˜cer\nSustainability Division\n41  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n2.1\n Organization\n\nThe main pillars of sustainability at \nFUCHS\n are optimiza\n-tion and continuous development in line with the chang\n-ing conditions of our time. Since establishing the inde\n-pen\ndent Sustainability Division in \n2011\n, we have been \ncontinuously working on improvements in cooperation \nwith various divisions of the company and, in \n2019\n, we \nachieved further milestones at our global \nFUCHS\n loca\n-tions, in partnership projects with industrial companies \nwithin and beyond the lubricants and chemicals industry \nand in cooperation with the relevant lubricants industry \n\nassociations.\nParticular highlights include: \n\nThe ﬁLife Cycle Analysis of Hydraulic Fluidsﬂ cooperative \nproject was carried out in partnership with \nBASF\n™s Fuel \nand Lubricant Solutions unit. In a departure from the \nstandard approach of focusing only on the manufacture \nof products when considering the emissions generated, \nthe project assessed the entire life cycle of various \nhydraulic ˚uids for the ˜rst time, from the procurement \nof raw materials, to the production and use phase at the \ncustomer and the disposal of waste oils. \n\nUnder \nFUCHS\n™ leadership, the Union of the European \nLubricant Industry™s (\nUEIL\n) Sustainability Task Force \nstarted its work in the spring of \n2019\n. Founded in the \nfall of last year, the working group™s goal is to develop \nharmonized sustainability standards, performance indi\n-cators and benchmarks for the European lubricant indus\n-try in cooperation with representatives of the entire \nprocess chain. It is intended that these criteria will enable \nlubricants companies to measure, manage, modify and \nreport on their sustainability moving ahead. This will also \nallow the comparability of sustainability between com\n-panies and year-on-year comparisons by the same com\n-pany.\n\nThe full-day \nFUCHS\n EVONIK\n Forum (\nFEF\n) was held for \nthe second time at \nFUCHS\n™ head of˜ce in Mannheim in \nfall \n2019\n. In addition to the latest issues, division heads \nfor sustainability, product management, development, \n\nprocurement, innovation and quality management dis\n-cussed projects on CO\n2 emissions, e-mobility, quality \nand purchasing standards and ongoing company-wide \ncollaboration. This gave rise to various ideas for fol\n-low-up projects at various levels. \n2.2 Management\n52.2\n Management\n1  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n\nFUCHS\n™ sustainability activities are assigned to the three \nsustainability dimensions of economy, ecology and society.\nEconomic sustainability\nWe consider economic responsibility to mean the long-\nterm alignment of our business with the goal of continu\n-ally increasing enterprise value for the bene˜t of our \nshareholders and other stakeholders. Accordingly, \nFUCHS\n bases its business decisions on realistic, economically \nsound and long-term goals, and follows a dividend policy \nthat targets constantly rising or, at the very least, stable \n\ndividend payouts.\nThe \nKPI\n for corporate control is \nFUCHS\n Value Added (\nFVA\n). \nFVA\n as a form of economic pro˜t is a catch-all term that \nencompasses both \nEBIT\n and capital employed. A key com\n-ponent of capital employed is net operating working cap\n-ital (\nNOWC\n). See annual report for further information.\nEcological sustainability\nEcological sustainability means the careful use of natural \nresources and the environment to guarantee a life of equal \nquality for future generations, and is a top priority at \nFUCHS\n. FUCHS\n therefore pays particular attention to the \nresponsible use of energy, water and raw materials. \nKnowledge of the current situation is a basic requirement \nin being able to manage the consumption of resources. \nFUCHS\n calculated its ecological footprint for the ˜rst time \nin \n2014\n, and updated these data in the past ˜scal year. \nThis means that \nFUCHS\n calculated the environmental \nimpact of business activities at its facilities across all loca\n-tions, which is known as a gate-to-gate analysis. Given \nFUCHS\n™ low vertical integration as a re˜ner at the end of \nthe process and value chain, the direct ecological footprint \nin lubricant manufacturing is relatively low. \nFUCHS\n there\n-fore differs from the conventional chemical industry.\nAfter calculating these unavoidable emissions, \nFUCHS\n made the decision to become climate neutral. This means \ncompensating for such unavoidable emissions by investing \nin high-quality climate protection projects. Even though \n\nthe goal of continuously reducing its ecological footprint \nthrough environmentally friendly production methods still \nstands, \nFUCHS\n is thus making an active contribution to \nreducing global CO\n2 emissions. The projects were selected \nin regions where \nFUCHS\n also operates to help the local \npopulation in the context of corporate citizenship.\n2.3 Dimensions\nInternal: \nEmployees\nExternal:  \nSociety\nSustainability\nRaw materials: \n Supplier\n / Supply\nLubricants: \n Production\n / Products\nShareholder \nValue\nStakeholder \nValue\nEconomic\nSocial\nEcological\nSustainability Dimensions\nEconomic indicators\nin • million\n2019\n2018\n2017\nFUCHS\n Value Added (\nFVA\n)174251250Earnings before interest \n and tax (\nEBIT\n)321383373Net operating working capital \n(NOWC\n) in\n %21.823.422.3Total dividend payout\n13413112662.3\n Dimensions\n1  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n\nHowever, the complete footprint of \nFUCHS\n lubricants is \nalso affected by factors in˚uencing the environment and \nresources used in connection with the extraction and \nsourcing of raw materials by our suppliers, the delivery of \n˜nished lubricants to our customers and their ultimate \ndisposal. \nFUCHS\n maintains contact with its suppliers in order to \nmeasure and manage the environmental impact of the \nraw materials used. \nFUCHS\n is striving for a joint approach \nto implementing sustainability along the entire process \nand value chain.\nBut the applications of \nFUCHS\n lubricant products are also \nimportant to \nFUCHS\n™ ecological sustainability. Here, \nFUCHS\n seeks to identify and, where possible, to increase \nthe positive effects achieved by customers during the use \nphase of \nFUCHS\n lubricant products by reducing friction, \nwear and corrosion. In keeping with goal no. \n17 ﬁPartner\n-ships for the goalsﬂ of Agenda \n2030\n, FUCHS\n is working \nwith companies in the chemicals industry to quantify the \nimpact of different lubricant formulations used by custom\n-ers to identify potential for optimization. \nRaw materials: Supplier\n / Supply\nThe production of lubricants is part of an extensive value \n\nchain and starts by purchasing commodities.\nThe raw materials used at \nFUCHS\n consist of complex \nchemical raw materials, renewable raw materials and a \nwide range of base ˚uids. \nFUCHS\n has undertaken signif\n-icant efforts to ensure that the raw materials used comply \nwith all \nEHS\n regulations (environmental, health and safety) \nand, parallel to this, invests in alternative raw material \n\nsolutions that help to protect the environment and \nresources.\nFor \nFUCHS\n, raw materials are a key element in the formu\n-lation of products. A carefully monitored and administered \nraw material portfolio ensures that the products currently \non the market are always available with a consistent level \n\nof quality.\nThe procurement of raw materials is organized both cen\n-trally and locally. \nFUCHS\n manages its strategically key sup\n-pliers with its central lead buyer concept, while the suppli\n-ers that are only relevant to the respective national \ncompanies are managed by the local procurement of˜cers.\nA continuous supply of raw materials and the prevention \n\nof procurement risks are guaranteed by a broad base and \na structured search for alternative suppliers. Technical \nworking groups assist procurement of˜cers in validating \nalternative sources of raw materials to rule out single sup\n-ply scenarios. Sustainable business services are also taken \ninto account when the company selects potential new \nsuppliers. Since the past ˜scal year, the CO\n2 emissions gen\n-erated by the production of a raw material have also been \n\ninquired about in the speci˜cations for raw materials. \nGiven the strategic importance of having key suppliers of \nnecessary raw materials at all times, \nFUCHS\n actively man\n-ages these relationships. The centrally managed \nFUCHS\n suppliers are assessed and systematically evaluated each \nyear in the global supplier evaluation based on various \ncriteria. In the event of any de˜cits in the ful˜llment of \nthese criteria, suppliers are issued with speci˜c action \nplans and implementation deadlines. The criteria assessed \nare business relations, pricing, technical aspects, quality, \norder and supplier management and sustainability aspects, \nincluding the carbon footprint of the raw materials sup\n-plied to \nFUCHS\n and possible CO\n2 reduction targets. This \ntakes into account the fact that most of \nFUCHS\n™ green\n-house gas emissions are generated not within the compa\n-ny™s own areas of operations Œ which it could control \ndirectly Œ but rather in the upstream supply chain. More \n\nweight was given to these criteria again for the ˜scal year \n2019\n assessment in order to illustrate to suppliers that \nFUCHS\n™ carbon neutral strategy extends to raw material \nprocurement as well.  \n72.3\n Dimensions\n1  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n\nAs a result, the supplier evaluation according to sustain\n-ability aspects led to the establishment of selected sus\n-tainable projects based on partnership. In this way, \nFUCHS\n is not only living up to its own responsibility, but is also \nencouraging its suppliers to do more to address the issue \n\nof sustainability. Our goal is to contribute to the continu\n-ous improvement of ecological sustainability in the value \nchain through cooperation with strategic suppliers and \nwork only with those suppliers who are also committed \n\nto this target. That not only applies in relation to resource \n\nef˜ciency and environmental standards, but also in order \nto increase the amount of environmentally friendly raw \nmaterials in our own production processes.\nLubricants: Production\n / Product\nFUCHS\n develops, produces and sells numerous lubricant \nproducts optimally tailored to the respective application, \n\nas well as emission reducing and environmentally friendly \nproducts. Thanks to their friction reduction, wear and \ncorrosion protection properties, \nFUCHS\n lubricants posi\n-tively contribute to prolonging running times of machines. \nCompared to conventional alternatives, they also increase \nthe ef˜ciency of customers™ production processes and \nthus make a positive contribution to saving on energy, \ncutting back greenhouse gas emissions and thereby con\n-serving resources. These effects are measurable using \nenvironmental performance evaluation and life cycle \nassessment and, in addition to performance and price, can \nbecome an additional differentiating characteristic and \nthus a competitive advantage for \nFUCHS\n.FUCHS\n is in the process of quantifying sustainability in its \nlubricants portfolio. Its aim is to develop a reference \nenabling it to categorize \nFUCHS\n products quantitatively in \nrelation to their sustainability. Our expectation is that the \n\nchange from a qualitative to a quantitative assessment of \n\necological sustainability will bring a signi˜cant progress in \n\nterms of the operationalization of environmental proper\n-ties and that this categorization will be a future speci˜ca\n-tion component for \nFUCHS\n lubricants. \nA key aspect of ecological sustainability management is \nFUCHS\n™ certi˜cation in accordance with the relevant \nISO\n standards. As of the end of \n2019\n \n65 % of production locations are certi˜ed according to \nthe \nISO\n 14001\n environmental management standard; \nand\n\nsix production locations in the \nEMEA\n region are certi\n-˜ed according to the \nISO\n 50001\n energy management \nstandard. \nIn \n2019\n, certi˜cation work focused on expanding the cer\n-ti˜cation required in the automotive sector in accordance \nwith \nIATF\n 16949\n. FUCHS\n successfully completed certi˜ca\n-tion for this standard at six other production locations. \nFUCHS\n is also still pushing for the certi˜cation of produc\n-tion locations in accordance with the relevant \nISO\n / IATF\n standards. The coordination of the global strategy for \ncerti˜cation in accordance with the \nISO\n 14001\n, ISO\n 45001\n and \nISO\n 50001\n environmental and occupational safety \nstandards is planned for \n2020\n. The \nFUCHS\n production sites are located in designated \nindustrial and commercial areas, and are planned and run \naccording to Group-wide safety and environmental speci\n-˜cations, so that as few substances as possible that could \n\nimpact biodiversity are released into the environment.\nEven though, as stated above, \nFUCHS\n™ ecological footprint \nis relatively small at the end of the process and value chain, \nthe objective still stands of continuing to reduce the eco\n-logical footprint with environmentally conscious produc\n-tion methods. \nFUCHS\n is therefore developing special tech\n-nologies and investing in state-of-the-art, safe systems for \nlubricant production, and in continuous process optimiza\n-tion. The goal is to minimize or further decrease its energy \nand water consumption as well as the waste arising in \nproduction operations and to reduce \nCO2 emissions. \n82.3\n Dimensions\n1  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n\nIn this way, \nFUCHS\n is planning to uphold the carbon neu\n-trality achieved from \n2020\n in future years through \nincreased internal optimization and standardization while \nscaling back compensation measures. \nFUCHS\n is currently working to gain a better ecological \nunderstanding of the production processes speci˜c to its \nportfolio and resource consumption of its locations on the \none hand and on opportunities for further resource sav\n-ings on the other. An internal sustainability initiative with \na cross-departmental steering committee sponsored by \nthe \nCTO\n is intended to ensure that processes continue to \nbe optimized throughout the Group.\nEcological indicators\nFUCHS\n™ water consumption per ton of lubricant produced \nremained constant year-on-year, and its waste volume was \neven reduced back to the \n2017\n level. \nThe fact that the indicators are still subject to climatic \nconditions even in spite of all the process optimization that \nhas been achieved is shown by the development of energy \nconsumption and the associated CO\n2 emissions per tonne \nof lubricant produced. Adverse climatic factors in the \nUS and Canada at the start of the year increased the energy \n\nconsumption required for the storage and processing of \nraw materials. Another factor that caused indicators to \nrise were the various new plant buildings in which all pro\n-duction processes had to be tested on start-up without \n\ngenerating any effective production.\n10020030020192018\n2017Development of energy consumption\n (in kilowatt hours per ton produced)\nBasis: \nFUCHS\n production locations.\n 2019\n2018\n2017Development of water consumption\n (in liter per ton produced)\n100200300400500\nBasis: \nFUCHS\n production locations.\n2019\n2018\n2017Waste generation\n (in kilograms per ton produced)\n102030Basis: \nFUCHS\n production locations.\n204060802019\n2018\n2017CO2 emissions\n (in kilograms per ton produced)\n Scope \n1: direct emissions through own energy generation.\n Scope \n2: indirect emissions through purchased energy.\nBasis: \nFUCHS\n production locations.\n92.3\n Dimensions\n1  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n\nSocial sustainability\nSocial sustainability has an internal and an external com\n-ponent and for \nFUCHS\n it means taking responsibility for \nits employees and for society in equal measure.\nInternal: Employees\nWe see our employees as the foundation of our success. \nFUCHS\n undertakes to uphold human rights and labor \nstandards and to promote health and safety in the work\n-place. As part of our sustainable personnel management, \nwe have therefore implemented projects in the ˜elds of \nhealth management, continuing professional develop\n-ment and work-life balance.\nWork safety is of great importance to \nFUCHS\n. The com\n-pany is subject to various national and international reg\n-ulations on occupational health and safety at our different \nlocations. The respective applicable occupational health \nand safety provisions form the minimum standard for the \n\nentrepreneurial measures to be implemented. All \nFUCHS\n employees have been informed of the laws, regulations \nand internal occupational health and safety guidelines \nrelevant to them and are instructed to comply with them. \n\nEmployees are advised to be constantly mindful of poten\n-tial hazards in their activities and their working environ\n-ment, both in their own interests and in the interests of \n\ntheir co-workers.\n40 % of the production locations were certi˜ed according \nto the \nOHSAS\n 18001\n (Occupational Health and Safety \nManagement System) at the end of \n2019\n. Certi˜cates in \naccordance with \nOHSAS\n 18001\n may only be issued until \nMarch \n11, 2021\n. Thereafter, only certi˜cation of health \nand safety at work in accordance with the new \nISO\n stan\n-dard \n45001\n ﬁOccupational Health and Safety Manage\n-ment Systemsﬂ published in March \n2018\n is still possible. \nFUCHS\n has decided to strive for new certi˜cations only in \naccordance with the new \nISO\n standard \n45001\n. As the \nrequirements are more extensive than those of the previ\n-ous \nOHSAS\n 18001\n standard, the aim is to increase the \nshare of certi˜ed production sites to \n50 % in the next two \nyears.\nNeeds-driven continuing professional development is our \nfoundation for developing specialist personnel and \nemployees with high potential. As a global training insti\n-tution, the \nFUCHS\n ACADEMY\n not only regularly offers \nseminars on a wide range of technical subjects; it is also \na very popular learning platform for junior staff and \nemployees with high potential, which helps to ensure the \n\ncontinuous and targeted further development of \nFUCHS\n employees.\nWe consistently pursue the objective of ˜nding the opti\n-mum balance between the business interests of \nFUCHS\n and the private and family needs of our employees, and \ntherefore help the latter to combine a career with family. \nFlexible working time models are an important part of this.\nThe social indicators, which have largely remained stable, \n\nform the basis for the strategic outlook of the Group™s \nHR work.\n102.3\n Dimensions\n1  Foreword\n 2  Sustainability at \nFUCHS\n 3  Sustainable Development Goals\n\nSocial indicators\n 2019\n2018\n2017\nAverage age of employees in years\n434343Age structure of employees in\n %   &lt; 30 years\n15161631\n Œ 40 years\n29282841\n Œ 50 years\n272828&gt; 50 years\n292828Average length of service of employees in years\n101010Employee ˚uctuation\n 1 in\n %4.24.74.1Work-related accidents\n 2 per 1,000 employees\n131516Days lost due to sickness per employee\n887Proportion of women in management positions in\n %222222Average further training and education per employee in hours\n1314 \n151 Share of employees leaving the company voluntarily.\n2 Number of accidents with an absence of more than three days.\nExternal: Society\nIn the context of its corporate citizenship, \nFUCHS\n takes \nsocial responsibility not just at its corporate headquarters \nin Mannheim, but also largely at its subsidiaries in other \ncountries. \nFUCHS\n employees do volunteer work for a \nnumber of local projects, though existing social projects \n\nare also helped and funded by means of donations.\nCorporate citizenship is a ˜xed component of the corpo\n-rate culture at \nFUCHS\n.

We use an operational control approach to de˜ne our \n\nboundary. The base year for emissions reductions is 2010. Emissions are recalculated back to the base year when a change to a prior inventory would result in a change in emissions of 0.5%  \n\nor greater. Scope 1 and 2 calculations are based on site-speci˜c data for fuel consumed and utilities purchased, applying published emissions factors and global warming potentials (GWPs).  \n\nScope 3 calculations are based on data for the relevant activity, applying published emissions factors and GWPs. Where actual data is not available, estimates are made based on actual  \n\ndata collected in prior years. The gases included in the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are CO2 , CH4, N2 O, HFCs and PFCs. Our market-based GHG emissions include the impact  \n\nof renewable energy certi˜cates (RECs) purchased in the U.S. and Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) purchased in the U.K. All U.S. RECs purchased by Bank of America are  \n\nGreen-e certi˜ed. Emissions re˚ect supplier-speci˜c emission rates where available, all of which comply with Scope 2 Guidance criteria. Emissions re˚ect residual mix factors for European  \n\nfacilities. Residual mix factors are not currently available for facilities outside of Europe. Location-based emission factors are used to quantify electricity-related Scope 3 emissions. \n*The methodology to calculate Scope 3 emissions in Category 1 and 2 changed in 2016. As a result, 2016 and later emissions in these categories are not comparable to emissions in prior years. \n\n12Greenhouse  gas emissions \nby region\nUnits \nScope 1 \ndirect \nemissionsScope 2 \nindirect \nemissionsTotal  \n\nScope 1 \nand  \nScope 2 \nemissionsScope 1 \ndirect \nemissionsScope 2 \nindirect \nemissionsTotal  \n\nScope 1 \nand  \nScope 2  \nemissionsMetric tons CO2e75,407721,661797,06875,40786,743162,150\nMetric tons CO2e1,47776,55978,0361,47776,55978,036EMEAMetric tons CO2e5,28135,78641,0675,2818,16413,445Latin AmericaMetric tons CO2e1312,0472,1781312,0472,178Greenhouse  \ngas emissions \nby country\nUnits \nScope 1 \ndirect \nemissionsScope 2 \nindirect \nemissionsTotal  \n\nScope 1 \nand  \nScope 2 \nemissionsScope 1 \ndirect \nemissionsScope 2 \nindirect \nemissionsTotal  \n\nScope 1 \nand  \nScope 2  \nemissionsUnited StatesMetric tons CO2e75,253721,452796,70575,25386,534161,787IndiaMetric tons CO2e1,13948,49149,6301,13948,49149,630United KingdomMetric tons CO2e3,67731,86035,5383,6773,1346,811ChinaMetric tons CO2e16213,57713,73916213,57713,739Southeast Asia -  \nSingapore, Malaysia, \nPhilippines, Thailand,  \nand IndonesiaMetric tons CO2e456,1896,234456,1896,234JapanMetric tons CO2e805,0205,100805,0205,100IrelandMetric tons CO2e5701,0651,6355701,8862,456AustraliaMetric tons CO2e81,4911,49981,4911,499ItalyMetric tons CO2e1738931,0661731,0291,201MexicoMetric tons CO2e5993799759937997South AfricaMetric tons CO2e1844346218443462RussiaMetric tons CO2e102321423102321423CanadaMetric tons CO2e1542093631542093632017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissions\n13Greenhouse  gas emissions \nby country\nUnits \nScope 1 \ndirect \nemissionsScope 2 \nindirect \nemissionsTotal  \n\nScope 1 \nand  \nScope 2 \nemissionsScope 1 \ndirect \nemissionsScope 2 \nindirect \nemissionsTotal  \n\nScope 1 \nand  \nScope 2  \nemissions2017 Location-based emissions2017 Market-based emissionsGermanyMetric tons CO2e02712720411412Saudi ArabiaMetric tons CO2e51982035198203BrazilMetric tons CO2e4314418743144187France\nMetric tons CO2e112940112233Rest of world\nMetric tons CO2e7983,4614,2587983,4774,274NOx, SOx, and other   \nfrom direct combustionUnits \n2010201520162017SOx Metric tons17111NOx Metric tons45252120COMetric tons56383331VOC\nMetric tons4422PMMetric tons7233Ozone depleting substances Metric tons  \nCFC -11e14171412Data are sourced from the Scope 1 and 2 inventory and records kept through our compliance program.

A responsible approach to employees, \nsuppliers, customers, and neighbors is a matter of course for us, \nwhether in direct business operations or in the surrounding areas. \nThe same applies to the environment, as we are aware of the \nlimits of natural resources and want to keep negative impacts \nfrom our business activities to a minimum.\nWith this separate Non-Financial Report (NFR), Aurubis fulfills its \nobligation to disclose non-financial information for fiscal year \n˜˚˛˝/˜˚ pursuant to Sections ˙˛ˆb and ˙˛ˆc in conjunction with \nSections ˜ˇ˝b to ˜ˇ˝e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). \nWe use the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI) \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝˙\n as a guide in \ndescribing the concepts and selected KPIs.\nThe main external factors influencing business development are \ndescribed in the Risk and Opportunity Report of the Combined \nManagement Report. Risks related to non-financial aspects \nbeyond the company boundaries are also mentioned there. Risks \nwere assessed in accordance with Section ˜ˇ˝c (˙) of the German \nCommercial Code (HGB). In the process, no non-financial risks \nwere identified that were very likely to cause a serious negative \nimpact on employee and environmental matters, on respect for \nhuman rights, on the prevention of corruption and bribery, or on \nsocial matters. Nevertheless, it is important to us to handle non-\nfinancial risks even if they are evaluated as non-material according \nto the strict definition of the HGB. We have developed and \nimplemented management approaches accordingly.\nAurubis Sustainability Strategy\nSince introducing the company vision in ˜˚˛˘, Aurubis has \ndeveloped into a multimetal group. This transformation is firmly \nestablished in the corporate strategy, which also includes \nsustainability as an integral pillar. We aim to enhance our \nsustainability achievements continuously, beyond the legal \nrequirements.\nIn ˜˚˛ˇ, the Aurubis Executive Board and Supervisory Board \npassed the Sustainability Strategy ˜˚˛ˇŒ˜˚˜˙, the continuation \n of the Sustainability Strategy passed in ˜˚˛˙. Based on the \naspects ﬁPeoplnvironmenconomy,ﬂ it comprises nine \naction areas for a period of five years (\n see illustration\n). These are \ntranslated into concrete targets and measures for which we have \nestablished implementation deadlines and key performance \nindicators (KPIs) so that our sustainable company development \ncan be measured and guided. During the reporting year, we \nsubjected our Sustainability Strategy to an interim review. The \nupdated strategy should be passed and published by the \nExecutive Board in the new fiscal year. The individual measures\n of the current Sustainability Strategy and the status of their \nimplementation are in this report at the end of the description \n of each action area.\nAurubis Sustainability Strategy\n As part of our responsible business conduct, the topics of \ncompliance and human rights also play a key role in addition to \nthe nine actions areas, complementing the key aspects of \nﬁPeoplnvironment Œ Economy.ﬂ Furthermore, we address \n˜˚Sustainability\n\nother significant interdisciplinary topics such as sustainable \nfinance \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝ˆ\n. Aurubis supports the work of the \nEction Plan on Sustainable Finance at European level and the \nGerman federal government™s Sustainable Finance Committee \n at national level. These deal with political issues regarding the \nclassification of sustainable products or possible liability \nregulations for risks in the supply chain, for example. Because \n it affects several of our sustainability activities, such as climate \nprotection, protection and respect for human rights, and the \ncircular economy, sustainable finance extends across multiple \naction areas of the Sustainability Strategy and therefore cannot \nbe clearly classified under the matters outlined in Section ˜ˇ˝c (˙) \nof the German Commercial Code (HGB). Notably, Aurubis \n itself is active in utilizing sustainable financing instruments: in \n the reporting year, we were the first European company in the \nbasic materials industry to place an ESG-linked Schuldschein loan \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝˙\n, to finance the acquisition of the recycling \ncompany Metallo and other general company financing needs. \n Aspects relevant for Aurubis\nWhen selecting the aspects for the Non-Financial Report, \n we were guided by both the main action areas of the company™s \nSustainability Strategy and the non-financial topics that are \nrequired to understand the business development, the business \nresult, the company™s position, and the impacts of our activities \n on these aspects. \nOne proven tool in our strategy work used to determine the \nrelevant reporting issues is the materiality analysis \n˚Glossary, \npage˚˛˝ˆ\n. To prepare the first Non-Financial Report in ˜˚˛ˇ, the \naction areas of the Sustainability Strategy were reviewed to \nensure that they fulfilled the materiality criteria in accordance \nwith the definitions of the German Commercial Code (HGB). We \nupdated the materiality analysis in the reporting year with the \nassistance of internal experts. This was based on a revised list of \npotentially material topics that included new sustainability \naspects in our industry that are more relevant for the future. \n The resulting list of material topics and focuses of the strategic \naction areas didn™t change fundamentally as a result of the \nanalysis. The Executive Board confirmed the results. The topics \nidentified as material in this process are assigned to the action \nareas of the Aurubis Sustainability Strategy in the Non-Financial \nReport. We present topics that have the same management \napproach in a consolidated format below. The analysis also \nprovided an impetus for the strategy update.\nWe also assume corporate responsibility in those instances \n in which the topics have no direct impact on our business \ndevelopment but are of considerable importance for us and \n our stakeholders. This is why the topic of social matters is \n part of our report and labeled as such.\nOverview of material topics\nMaterial \naccording \nto German \nCommercial \nCode\nMaterial \nfor Aurubis\nPage \nin \nNFR\nEmployee-\nrelated \nmatters\nFuture-oriented \nemployer\n˜˜ ˇ˘Training and \neducation\n˜˜ Health and safety\n˜˜ Environmental \nmatters\nEnergy and climate\n˜˜ Protection from \nenvironmental \nimpact\n˜˜ Recycling solutions\n˜˜ Social matters\nSocial engagement\n˜ Human rights\nResponsible supply \nchain\n˜˜ Anti-\ncorruption\nAnti-corruption\n˜˜  ˜˛Sustainability\n\nSustainability management\nFrom an organizational perspective, the Sustainability \ndepartment is part of the Corporate Communications, Investor \nRelations &amp; Sustainability division, whose supervisor reports \ndirectly to the Executive Board chairman, who in turn bears the \noverall responsibility for the issue of sustainability in the Aurubis \nGroup. The Sustainability department serves as the interface \nbetween the departments relevant for the topic of sustainability \nand coordinates all of the related processes in the Group, serving \nas a contact for the sites. At the same time, it is also responsible \nfor continuously reviewing and developing the sustainability \ntargets and supporting the operational implementation of the \nmeasures with the relevant divisions. Moreover, the department \nmanages sustainability reporting and communication. It is \ntherefore the point of contact for ESG rating agencies. \nFurthermore, it assists with supplier screening based on \nsustainability criteria.\nWe make our sustainability achievements transparent in a variety \nof ways. These include participation in sustainability rankings \n and ratings such as the CDP \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝˙\n (a non-profit \norganization that advocates for climate reporting), and the \nvoluntary reporting of the past several years. Our Sustainability \nReports are guided by the GRI Standards and are released every \ntwo years, with the next one in spring ˜˚˜˛ covering fiscal year \n˜˚˛˝/˜˚. In the years without a Sustainability Report, the KPIs \n are updated and released separately in a consolidated form.\nWe communicate regularly with our key stakeholders about \nsustainability-related topics. We believe it is important to \nmaintain a dialogue with employees, customers, suppliers, \npoliticians and society, capital market participants, the media, \nnon-governmental organizations, and the scientific community.\n Description of the business model and \npresentation of the Group structure\nWe are continuing to develop our business model consistently \n in alignment with the company™s Vision ˜˚˜ˆ. Today, Aurubis™ \nmain focus is on the production and processing of copper and \nother non-ferrous metals. Aurubis primarily processes copper \nconcentrates that are mined from ores and sourced on the global \nmarket. The company purchases the necessary raw materials, as it \ndoesn™t own any mines or stakes in mines. The processing of \nsecondary raw materials plays an important role as well. \nCorresponding to our vision, we are purposefully expanding our \nbusiness model towards a broader multimetal approach. This \nmeans that, in addition to copper, other metals are extracted from \nraw materials and intermediate products and then processed into \nmarketable products with added value. \nCorporate governance and the principles of responsible and \nsustainable company management determine Aurubis™ actions. \nAdditional information is available in the sections \n Corporate \nGovernance, pagesŒ\n.Aurubis AG is the parent company of the Aurubis Group and is \nbased in Hamburg, with production sites in Hamburg and Lünen. \nFor us, sustainability applies to the entire Group. Consequently, \nthe action areas and measures are relevant for the Group and \n for Aurubis AG. The key indicators mentioned in this report are \nrecorded at Aurubis in the individual departments and \nconsolidated at Group level. All environmental and energy KPIs \nare reported for calendar year ˜˚˛˝, not fiscal year ˜˚˛˝/˜˚.\n˛  As a result, the Metallo sites are not included in these KPIs. The \ninclusion of the Metallo KPIs from ˜˚˛˝ had no significant impact \non the relative environmental KPIs reported here. Metallo will be \nfully integrated in the KPIs shown in this report in the coming \nyear. When the following report mentions copper production in \nthe context of environmental KPIs, this refers to primary and \nsecondary copper production \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝ˆ\n at the Hamburg, \nLünen, Olen, and Pirdop sites. Significant differences between \nAurubis AG KPIs and Group KPIs are explained.\n˛  \nThe KPIs are primarily used for internal management purposes and governmental \nreporting, for which the calendar year is prescribed as the reporting period. Reporting \non calendar year and fiscal year figures in parallel could lead to confusion and \nambiguities.\n˜˝Sustainability\n\nEmployer-related matters\nFUTURE˚ORIENTED EMPLOYER\nCompetent, productive, and enthusiastic employees form the \nbasis of the Aurubis Group™s commercial success and further \ndevelopment. We have set ourselves the target of creating a \n work environment for good, close cooperation and promoting \ninvolvement and creativity. We form a team that works toward \n the company™s progresven in challenging times.\nAll overarching activities related to our employees are managed \n at Group level by Human Resources (HR), whose management \nreports directly to the CEO. HR is particularly involved with the \nHR strategy of the entire Group, as well as the implementation \nand monitoring of the resulting strategic HR instruments, \nespecially those related to organizational and staff development, \ncompensation and fringe benefits, employer branding, and \nsupporting improvement and change processes. The work of the \nlocal HR departments is oriented toward the standards of the \ncentral HR division and local conditions.\nOur HR strategy is derived from the Group strategy and is based \non the corporate values. It is developed continuously, taking labor \nmarket changes, societal transitions, and trends in HR work into \nconsideration. One focus is on the lack of qualified workers due to \nthe demographic shift, as well as the search for young employees \nand apprentices, which is becoming more and more difficult. \nCurrent topics that are picking up momentum influenced HR \nstrategy work during the reporting period, such as the progress in \ndigitalization and trials with different ways of working that arose \nor sped up due to individual ad hoc solutions in the course of the \ncoronavirus pandemic.\nFurthermore, HR work during the reporting year also \nconcentrated on the current Performance Improvement Program \nfocused on cost reduction. In the course of this program, we will \ncut approximately ˜˛˚ full-time equivalent (FTE) positions in the \nCorporate Functions and the Hamburg plant until fiscal year \n˜˚˜˜/˜˙. The job cuts will follow socially responsible principles. \nFor example, we will try to prevent as many redundancies as \npossible by not filling certain open positions, offering an improved \nearly retirement scheme, and facilitating internal job changes. The \nemployee representatives were and are involved in the process. \nAnother focus was on structuring and supporting organizational \nchanges such as the Metallo integration, the acquisition of the \n IT company azeti, and the closure of the CABLO site in Strass.\n¹Diversity in the personnel structure is important to us. The Code \nof Conduct and our corporate values serve as the basis for \nrespectful cooperation.\n² For us, a diverse workforce is conducive \nto company success thanks to the knowledge transfer, different \nviewpoints, and open collaboration that it fosters. We consider \ndiversity to include not only cultural aspects and international \nrepresentation, but also diversity in terms of specialized skills and \nage groups, as well as a gender balance. Our objective is to \nprevent these and other aspects of diversity such as religious or \npolitical views, sexual orientation, or disabilities from playing a \nrole in hiring decisions or in an individual™s continued career. \nConsequently, compensation also depends on the job performed, \nthe quality of the work, and the level of professional experience. \nOne of our goals is to increase the proportion of female \nmanagerndependently of legal stipulations, which we fulfill by \ndefining concrete target parameters for the first and second \nmanagement levels under the Executive Board. More information \nabout the diversity concept is available in the \n Corporate Governance \nReport, pages ˛˝\nŒ.˛  \nThe Cablo site had to be discontinued for economic reasons. Eleven salaried employees \nhad to be made redundant as a result.\n˜  The current Code of Conduct of the Metallo sites that were acquired in ˜˚˜˚ is \nfundamentally similar to Aurubis™ Code of Conduct. The final harmonization of Metallo™s \npolicies and commitments with those of Aurubis, including the Code of Conduct, is still \npending.\n˙ˆSustainability\n\nWe offer our employees an attractive work environment and \nsupport them by offering options allowing them to establish a \ngood work/life balance. In this regard, making working-time \nmodels more flexible and modern is of high importance. In \nconnection with the coronavirus crisis, for instance, the start and \nend times of shifts were made more flexible and options for \nremote work were further expanded. The experience gained in \nthe process will be used in the further development of a modern \nwork organization that takes employee needs into account.\nWe prioritize good cooperation between everyone in the \ncompany and offer attractive compensation in line with the \nmarket. Compensation and fringe benefits are regulated in \ncollective wage agreements. At our only production site \n outside of Europe, Aurubis Buffalo, where social security isn™t \ncomprehensively regulated by law, we assume ˇ\n % of the \nemployees™ health insurance contributions.\nTo read more about our training and employee qualification \nactivities, refer to the section \n Training and education, pag˛\n.

The related development \ninstruments and measures are now in the targets of the \ntraining and education action area.\n» Regularly identifying employees™ needs with respect to working-\ntime arrangements\n A number of solutions were expanded significantly in both \nindividual and collective agreements. In connection with the \ncoronavirus crisis, for instance, the start and end times for shift \nemployees were made more flexible and the remote work \noption was expanded considerably. The flextime program is \nreviewed and developed continuously.\n» Developing a diversity policy\n In the course of updating the Sustainability Strategy, this \ntarget is being revised and additional measures are being \nestablished.\n˛  The OHI indicates the ﬁhealthﬂ of a company, e.g., how well a company is equipped to \nreact to changes in the market and thus to achieve economic success sustainably.

The ongoing individual \ndevelopment of our employees and sound training for young \ntalents have high priority in this regard.\nHR is responsible for staff development. It supports the other \ndepartments, in close coordination with the local HR managers, in \nbuilding employees™ skills in a directed way tailored to their needs. \nThe objective is to meet current and future requirements and \nchallenges.\nTo secure qualified personnel in the long term, we regularly assess \ndemand for specific skills and trades, and offer apprenticeships \naccordingly. We also identify the demand for employee \nqualifications and successors for different positions in annual talks \nand in the yearly personnel planning process in order to develop \nand expand specialized skills and management expertise in a \npurposeful way.\n˙ˇSustainability\n\nWe are continuing and expanding the training offerings in our \nleadership and qualification program according to the Group™s \nneeds. In particular, options for managers at the foreman level \nremain a top priority. Employees are offered a number of \ntechnical training measures as well as options for personal \ndevelopment.\nIn addition to qualification and development programs geared \n to necessary skills, for example in the areas of the Aurubis \nOperating System (AOS) \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝˙\n and in project \nmanagement, we also rely on platforms for networking and \ndiscussing best practices (e.g., expert panels and online learning \ngroups). We frequently evaluate the different qualification options \nand adjust them as needed. Since the last reporting year, we \n have successfully carried out our one- to two-hour micro-learning \nunits called Learning Nuggets, in which participants learn and \n test new skills. The short Aurubis Essentials seminars educate \ninterested colleagues about interdisciplinary topics, promoting a \nuniform, company-wide understanding of these issues.\nOur goal is to continue fostering digital and self-guided learning \nas well as innovative learning methods within the Group. Thanks \nto digital training formats, many Aurubis Essentials and Learning \nNuggets took place online during the coronavirus pandemic. The \ninsights from using the digital learning formats are valuable for \nthe ongoing development of our learning organization. \nAurubis is one of the largest training companies in the chemical \nindustry in Germany. We are proud of our training and retention \nrate, which makes an important contribution to securing a qualified \nworkforce. At our site in Pirdop, Bulgaria, we implemented a \nvocational training program based on the Swiss training model a \nfew years ago.\nAurubis Hamburg has been participating in the internship \n model AV ˛˚-Plus since ˜˚˚˘. The model supports young people \nfrom a range of occupational groups, helping them to gain the \nqualifications required to begin apprenticeships. In ˜˚˛˝/˜˚, seven \nof the ten participants took on an apprenticeship at Aurubis. The \nremaining participants started external apprenticeships or have \ngone on to pursue higher education.\nIn ˜˚˛˝, we inaugurated two modern training centers in Lünen \nand Hamburg. In Lünen, the ATASI building is home to the \ndivisions Training (including the training workshop), Occupational \nSafety and Technology. In Hamburg, the Training and Research &amp; \nDevelopment (R&amp;D) divisions are located in the Innovation and \nTraining Center (IAZ). The new buildings lay the foundation for \nincreasing the number of apprenticeships.\nThe coronavirus pandemic posed a significant challenge for \nvocational training during the reporting year. With the help of \ndigital learning supports and communication formats, vocational \ntraining continued almost seamlessly while taking the necessary \nprecautions into account. The experience from working digitally \nwill be considered in vocational training work in the future. \nAurubis maintains its plans to increase the company™s number of \napprentices.\nAurubis takes part in educational marketing at fairs and school \nevents. To better address potential applicants, the vocational \ntraining website was revamped and new video clips about \napprenticeship trades were produced during the reporting year. \nFurthermore, we cooperate with partner universities, offer \ninternships to students in Germany, and facilitate thesis projects.\nKey measures of the Sustainability Strategy ˇˆ˘˛Œˇˆˇd \ntheir status in fiscal year ˇˆ˘˝/ˇˆ\n» Regularly identifying qualification needs to expand project, \nprocess, and management expertise in a targeted way\n In the reporting year, the gradual rollout of the skills matrix \nstarted in all of the plants to systematically record qualification \nneeds, and qualification planning for technical and specialized \ntraining began accordingly. Moreover, the establishment of \nGroup-wide project management standards was initiated, with \nthe introduction of a learning path to provide project \nmanagers with the appropriate qualifications. Our Group \nprocess managers were certified in accordance with these \nstandards; additional employees in the company will be \nintroduced to the standards as well.\nSustainability\n\n» Group-wide introduction of the AOS pillar ﬁEducation and \nTrainingﬂ\n The AOS pillar was integrated in the AOS Operations area. \n At the Hamburg plant, employees were qualified as AOS \nexperts in a modular training program. The planning for \nequivalent AOS expert qualifications at the other plants is \nunderway and this will be carried out as needed.\n» Establishing Group-wide knowledge management to identify, \npreserve, transfer, and enhance knowledge across functions\n The knowledge transfer pilot phase was successfully \nconcluded. Due to the participants™ positive experience, \nknowledge transfer was established as a knowledge \nmanagement method as part of succession planning at \nAurubiG. The knowledge transfer process is enshrined in \nthe company™s succession arrangements.

Our \ngoal for the medium term is to reduce the number of work-related \naccidents with at least one lost shift per one million hours worked \n(lost time injury frequency rate, LTIFR \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝ˆ\n) t.˚.\nThe corporate department Group Health &amp; Safety manages \n OHS and establishes minimum occupational safety standards \n for the entire Group by issuing process instructions in addition \n to the Corporate Policy on Occupational Health and Safety. \n The department™s management reports directly to the Executive \nBoard member overseeing the Operations division. Our \noccupational safety approach applies to our employees, \ntemporary workers, and external service providers. Occupational \nsafety management at the sites is currently being developed to \nconform to the requirements of ISˆ˚˚˛ \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝ˆ\n.  Six sites (Avellino, Berango, Dolný Kubín, Pirdop, Pori, and \nMortara) are already certified in accordance with ISˆ˚˚˛, \n while Schwermetall Halbzeugwerk is certified in accordance \n with OHSAS BS ˛ˇ˚˚˛. All Aurubis production sites should be \ncertified in accordance with ISˆ˚˚˛ by June ˜˚˜˛.\n˛The site managers play a key role because they are responsible for \ncomplying with applicable laws and ordinances on occupational \nhealth and safety, the relevant corporate policy, and the current \nprocess instructions. Furthermore, they gather and evaluate \nhealth risks and help implement suitable measures to protect \nemployees. The sites are in contact with each other via an \norganized network facilitated by Group Health &amp; Safety so that \nexisting knowledge can be used Group-wide. Moreover, employee \nrepresentatives are included in the topic of OHS: through the \nreporting line to the Executive Board, Group Health &amp; Safety \n also reports to the general Works Council committee and the \nEuropean Works Council during committee meetings.\n˛  With the exception of the newly acquired Metallo site in Belgium\n (certification by March ˜˚˜˜ planned).\n˙˜Sustainability\n\nOur risk assessments include both current and future work \nprocesses in the company, including maintenance and repair \nprocedures in addition to operations. The risk assessments cover \nhazards in normal operations, special work assignments, and \nabnormal incidents. Health hazards and individual requirements \nin the work area are systematically collected, evaluated, and \ndocumented. For this purpose, OHS management software is \nbeing used more and more at the sites; among other things, the \nsoftware enables experiences to be shared internally. In this way, \nwe record potential health risks for each work area and derive \nmeasures from these insights.\nAccidents are systematically investigated to determine their \ntechnical, organizational, and conduct-based causes. The causes \ndetermined from accident investigations and the measures \nderived from them are communicated throughout the Group. \nThere is a monthly process for reporting accidents and incidents, \nand every accident is immediately reported to the Executive \nBoard. Because of our preventive measures, the accidents typical \nfor industry such as those involving molten metals, hazardous \nsubstances, and heavy loads are rare. Comparable to other \nindustries, the main causes of injuries are stumbling, slipping, or \nfalling.\nIn addition to technical and organizational precautions, the \noccupational safety conduct of every individual is essential. \n A preventive measure to avoid accidents, the Group-wide OHS \ncampaign ˛˚ Golden Rules (˛˚forZero) was initiated with the \nobjective of positively influencing occupational safety conduct. In \naddition, the sites in Hamburg, Lünen, Avellino, Emmerich, Pori, \nand Stolberg have a program for behavior-based safety (BBS). \nLegal compliance audits were also introduced to achieve internal \nimprovements. Furthermore, AOS was implemented at the \nHamburg, Lünen, Emmerich, Avellino, Pirdop, and Olen sites to \ncontinue structuring and standardizing Group-wide occupational \nsafety processene of the measures that strengthens our \nVision Zero.\nEmployees are informed about risks in the workplace and are \ninstructed about necessary preventive and protective measures, \nenhancing their awareness of these topics. Safety talks sensitize \nemployees to current OHS issues and encourage them to use this \nknowledge safely in practice.\nExternal service providers are instructed about hazards, protective \nmeasures, and rules of conduct at the specific site before they \nstart working.\nInternal company doctors are available at the Hamburg, Lünen, \nand Pirdop sites. At all of the other sites, freelance occupational \nphysicians are commissioned with carrying out obligatory and \noptional checkups. Health checkups are offered when new \nemployees are hired and routine occupational health checkups \nare provided.\nIn addition, we support employees in taking preventive measures \nto maintain their health. The offerings of the plant medical offices \nextend from flu vaccinations and medical checkups to addiction \nprevention, as well as supporting measures for the heart and \ncirculatory system. There are a number of activities to promote \nhealtor example, with respect to topics like integration \nmanagement for employees who have been ill, and healthy \nleadership. A task force is currently recording these activities for \nthe Hamburg headquarters and transferring them to a systematic, \nintegrated concept for company health management.\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis team was \nestablished at Group and site level that met online regularly, \ntogether with the entire Executive Board. In this way, specific \nemergency plans and measures were quickly established to \nprioritize protecting employees™ health while keeping operations \nup and running.\n˙˙Sustainability\n\nKey measures of the Sustainability Strategy ˇˆ˘˛Œˇˆˇd \ntheir status in fiscal year ˇˆ˘˝/ˇˆ\n» Preparing all sites for the introduction of the ISO ˜˚˛˛˝ standard \nfor occupational health and safety (by fiscal year ˙˛˝ˆ/˙˛)\n The adoption of ISˆ˚˚˛ at all production sites and slitting \ncenters should be concluded by June ˜˚˜˛, with the exception \nof the newly added Metallo site in Belgium (certification \nscheduled to take place by March ˜˚˜˜).\n Avellino, Pirdop, Pori, Dolný Kubín, Mortara, and Metallo \nBerango are already certified.\n  Certifications by site, pag\n» Implementing programs to promote occupational safety conduct \n(until fiscal year ˙˛˙˛/˙˝)\n Continued introduction of the Group-wide ˛˚ Golden Rules \n at eleven sites thus far.

LTIFR: Metallo included for the entire fiscal year so that KPIs can be compared.\n Prior-year figures adjusted.\nEnvironmental matters\nENERGY AND CLIMATE\nThe individual production steps in our value chain are energy-\nintensive. For us, the efficient use of energy is thus an issue of \necological and economic responsibility. The use of energy is the \nmain source of CO\n emissions in the Group. Taking the entire \nvalue chain into consideration, over half of the CO\n emissions are \nupstream and downstream, i.e., they originate from our suppliers, \ncustomers, and service providers (Scope ˙ emissions). Most of the \nScope ˙ emissions originate from the activities of the mining \ncompanies from which we source ore concentrates.\nAt the same time, the products we manufacture contribute to \nreducing CO\n emissions because they play an important role in \nrenewable energies and electric vehicles. Electric cars contain \nnearly four times more copper than vehicles with conventional \ncombustion engines, and building and connecting an offshore \nwind turbine to the energy grid requires up to ˙˚ t of copper. Our \nmetals can therefore contribute to the low-CO\n technologies of \nthe future.\nDetermining climate-related opportunities and risks and deriving \nrelated measures are two issues that link our risk management \nand our energy and environmental strategy. When doing this, \n we consider (pending) legal requirements, technological \ndevelopments, and compliance-related, reputational, and physical \nrisks. More information is available in the Risk and Opportunity \nReport of this Annual Report under ﬁEnergy and climate,ﬂ as well \nas in our publicly available CDP report \n˚<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aurubis.com/cdp/n">www.aurubis.com/cdp\n</a>. CDP \ngathers and evaluates data and information about companies™ \n CO emissions, climate risks, and reduction targets and strategies, \nassessing their responsibility in the supply chain in the process. \nWe voluntarily report our CO\n emissions annually as part of the \nCDP climate change program.\nWith our affirmation of the Science-Based Targets initiative, we \nare committed to setting a science-based climate target to reduce \nour CO\n emissions and thus contribute to limiting global warming \nto ˛.C in accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate \nchange. \n sciencebasedtargets.org\nSustainability\n\nOur Group-wide Corporate Energy &amp; Climate Policy outlines \n how Aurubis secures and optimizes the energy supply, energy \nconsumption, and CO\n avoidance. In this context, the policy also \ndefines the roles and responsibilities of the sites and corporate \ndepartments.\nThe head of Corporate Energy &amp; Climate Affairs develops and \nimplements the Group-wide energy strategy and reports directly \nto the Executive Board chairman. The corporate department also \ncoordinates the development of the energy management and \nmonitoring systems across the Group, providing for a uniform \napproach and facilitating the exchange of expertise regarding\n best practice exampleor instance in the form of an energy \nefficiency network for the German Aurubis sites™ energy \nmanagement officers and a regular international Aurubis \nworkshop.\nTo prevent CO\n emissions, we primarily focus on energy \n efficiency measures. Furthermore, we are increasingly considering \nmeasures to replace fossil fuels with alternatives, for example \n by commissioning the ˛˚ MW power-to-steam plant. Assuming \nthat ˛˚˚\n % of the power supply comes from renewable energies, \nthis plant alone could cut abou,˚˚˚ t of CO\n annually. The \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions is taking a higher priority \nin investment decisions as well.\nOur large production sites have energy management systems \n(EMS); nine sites are currently certified in accordance with \nIS˚˚˚˛ \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝ˆ\n. The management systems \ncontribute to efficiently steering energy consumption and \nidentifying energy savings potential. The EMS is being \nimplemented across the Group: most of the sites that are still \nmissing have started with the implementation of an EMS or \n their integration in existing environmental and/or quality \nmanagement systems. The EMS at the Hamburg and Lünen \n sites is part of the integrated management system for quality, \nenvironmental protection, energy, and occupational safety. \n During the reporting period, the certifications were confirmed \nthrough routine surveillance visits or recertification.\nThe more steps that have been implemented in energy efficiency \nin the past, the more challenging a further optimization is. \nMoreover, because there are limits to reducing energy \nconsumption and emissions, the improvements being achieved \ntoday within the plant boundaries are only marginal compared to \nprevious years. This is despite the same or higher levels of \ninvestment, which were already high to begin with. For example, \ncomplex recycling raw materials with relatively low metal \ncontents and complex ore concentrates require more energy to \nbe processed. As a result, we focus not only on further increasing \nefficiency but also on solutions that save energy and thus prevent \nCO outside of our planuch as the Industrial Heat project in \nHamburs well as on projects that contribute to the energy \nshift. Examples include the wind turbine in Olen, the flexible \nmode of operation in the production facilities in Hamburg, Lünen, \nand Olen, and the photovoltaic project planned in Pirdop for ˜˚˜˛. \nEnvironmental protection already accounts for a large part of the \nenergy consumption at Aurubis today. This includes the operation \nof filters with fans and other suctioning equipment, for instance. \nThis shows how important it is for Aurubis to align environmental \nprotection, resource conservation, and energy efficiency. \n  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aurubis.com/industrialheat/nThe">www.aurubis.com/industrialheat\nThe</a> use of renewable energies on a large scale is a challenge for \nus since generating them is associated with energy supply \nfluctuations. However, our production processes require a \nconstant energy supply. We are therefore working on measures to \nmake our energy uptake more flexible so that we can react to \nfluctuating energy availability and thus use more renewable \nenergies. In ˜˚˛˘, for instance, Metallo commissioned the largest \narc plasma furnace in the world. In the furnace™s reactor, metals \nare evaporated from the slags of plant processes. The slag is \ncleaned through this procedure and transformed into usable \nmetals and minerals. In contrast to other furnaces in the industry, \nthe furnace is electrically operated, which makes the use of \nrenewable energies possible.\nWe also cover a portion of our energy needs with electricity we \ngenerate internally using excess heat from our processes. We \ninstalled steam turbines for this purpose in Hamburg, Lünen, and \nPirdop. The calculated savings potential is ˙˚,˚˚˚ t of CO\n per \n˙˚Sustainability\n\nyear. The savings during the reporting period were lower, mainly \ndue to temporary outages or maintenance measures related to \nthe steam turbines and their surrounding areas. On top of that, \nwe use waste heat from the production processes to secure the \nheat and process steam supply at the Pirdop, Lünen, and \nHamburg sites. Demand there is largely covered by waste heat. \nWe efficiently use waste heat potential on a smaller scale, too, \n for instance by feeding waste heat from the air compressors into \nthe heating system at the Stolberg site.\nKey measures of the Sustainability Strategy ˇˆ˘˛Œˇˆˇd \ntheir status in fiscal year ˇˆ˘˝/ˇˆ\n¹» Introducing the ISO ˚˛˛˛˝ standard for energy management \n at all sites\n The Olen and Pori sites were certified in accordance with \nIS˚˚˚˛ for the first time during the reporting period. \n ˚Certifications by site, pag\n By the end of fiscal year ˜˚˛˝/˜˚, a milestone plan was drafted \nfor all production sites and a gap analysis was carried out for \nmost of them.\n» Increasing flexibility in electricity purchasing \n (target of ˝˛\n % by fiscal yearˇ˙˛˙˙/˙˘)\n Flexible electricity output amounted to ˛˘\n % in the reporting \nperiod.\n» Implementing projects to enhance energy efficiency and reduce \nemissions, with a total project-related reduction of ˝˛˛,˛˛˛ t CO\n A total of ˇ˘.˝\n % of the target has been achieved, or ˇ˝.˙\n % when including reductions made outside of the plant \n(particularly through the use of our industrial heat as district \nheating in the Hamburg HafenCity East district).\n» Investigating processes and electricity consumption in relation to \nthe German government™s Climate Action Plan ˙˛˚˛ and \nanalyzing the requirements for new investments (starting fiscal \nyear ˙˛˝/˝ˆ)\n In fiscal year ˜˚˛˝/˜˚, we affirmed the Science-Based Targets \ninitiative and committed to setting a science-based climate \ntarget to reduce our CO\n emissions.

With our \nmultimetal recycling, we actively take part in the modern circular \neconomy, promote the efficient and environmentally friendly use \nof valuable resources, and contribute to raw material security.\nAurubis plays a vital role in the recycling chain: thanks to our \nintegrated smelter network, we are able to process a broad range \nof materials, from industrial waste that accumulates directly from \nour production or our customers, to complex materials \n˚Glossary, \npage ˛˝˙\n from end-of-life products. From these materials, we \nproduce metals that can be directly used in new products.\nIn addition to the processing of copper concentrates, the \nrecycling of copper scrap and complex recycling raw materials \nsuch as circuit boards is a key business area at Aurubis. Non-\nferrous metals like copper can be recycled as often as desired \nwithout a loss of quality. This means that copper of the highest \npurity can be produced from recycling materials again and again. \nFurthermore, complex recycling raw materials contain not only \ncopper but a number of other accompanying elements that can \nbe recovered, such as gold, silver, nickel, tin, lead, and zinc.\nTo us, complex recycling raw materials include industrial residues, \nslimes, and shredder materials, as well as end-of-life materials that \nfor instance originate from electronic devices, vehicles, and other \neveryday items. These consist of increasingly diversified material \ncombinations that include plastics, ceramic, or glass. Separating \nthem into material and product streams by type in order to \n reuse them is a significant challenge. Furthermore, because of \nminiaturization, smaller and smaller amounts of metal are \ncontained in end-of-life electronic devices, for instance. We utilize \nhighly developed mechanical and metallurgical separating and \nrefining processes in different combinations as part of our \nmultimetal expertise. With our subsidiary Metallo, acquired in \n˜˚˜˚, non-ferrous metals such as tin and zinc will be recovered \neven more efficiently in the expanded smelter network.\nThe Commercial division is responsible for sourcing recycling \nmaterials for the Group. This is divided into the departments \nRecycling Raw Materials (which handles the material supply for \nthe smelters), Marketing Cathodes (which supplies the production \nfacilities with cathodes and ﬁdirect meltﬂ raw materials), and \nProduct Sales &amp; Marketing with the function Customer Scrap \nSolutions (which supplies the smelters and production facilities \nwith production waste from our copper product customers). \n This organization aligns with our recycling approach: we use \nsecondary materials from production and from end-of-life \nproducts as raw materials and view this as a closed loop.\nIn the marketing of our products and in our customer \nrelationships, we therefore include the return of the metals in \n our thinking. We provide individualized solutions for taking back \nrecycling materials that accumulate in the processing of our \ncopper products, as well as other metals in the different value-\nadded stages that take place with our product customers and \ntheir customers. Depending on the value-added stage, they \naccumulate materials with very high copper contents, such as \nMillberry scrap, which can be immediately directed to the copper \nproduction process, or more complex or alloyed production waste \nthat can also be smelted, such as copper-, tin-, lead-, and precious \nmetal-bearing stamping waste, slags from foundries, and other \nindustrial residues like used catalysts and galvanic slimes. This \ndemonstrates that thanks to our integrated smelter network, we \nfind solutions, even for significant metallurgical challenges, and \nare thus able to serve customers from a variety of sectorrom \nsmaller scrap traders to global industrial companies and \ncustomers of the recycling industry, all of which make up our \nbroad base of recycling raw material suppliers.\nAs part of our ﬁclosing-the-loopﬂ activities \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝˙\n, we \nbuild up partnerships through which we not only sell our products \nbut also take back recycling raw materials customers accumulate, \nin addition to other service offerings. For example, we process \nscrap that comes back to us from product customers with what \nare referred to as tolling contracts. The raw material cycle comes \nfull circle.\nSustainability\n\nAurubis processes recycling materials at different sites. The \nmanagers of these sites report to the chief operations officer. Our \nsites in Lünen (Germany) and Olen (Belgium), as well as the newly \nacquired Metallo sites in Beerse (Belgium) and Berango (Spain), \nspecialize in processing recycling raw materials. Recycling raw \nmaterials are nearly the only feedstock at our largest recycling \nplant, the Aurubis recycling center in Lünen. The Lünen plant is \ncertified through WEEELABEX in accordance with the European \nseries of standards EN ˆ˚˜ˆ. The certificate confirms that waste \nelectrical and electronic devices are efficiently treated and \ndisposed of in a way that minimizes environmental impacts and \nemissions of harmful substances. Aurubis participated in the \ndevelopment of the standards that preceded the series of \nstandards. The Metallo plants process about ˙˛ˆ,˚˚˚ t of complex \nsecondary raw materials each year to recover not only copper, tin \nand lead, but also metal intermediates such as nickel sulfate \nsolution and zinc oxide. Metallo follows a ﬁzero wasteﬂ strategy \nwith the goal of transforming as many scrap materials as possible \ninto valuable products. The company fosters this strategy with its \nﬁFurnace of Innovationﬂ approach, recycling increasingly complex \nraw materials and investing in technological innovations for the \nrefining process. Metallo therefore has a forerunner role in metal \nrecycling and optimally complements Aurubis™ similar approach.\nMoreover, we have two companies with unique expertise within \nthe Group: our subsidiary E.R.N. specializes in recycling electrical \nand electronic devices of all kinds, while CABLO specializes in \nrecycling our copper customers™ cable production waste and cable \nscrap. In November ˜˚˜˚, Aurubis and the recycling company TSR \nRecycling signed an agreement to establish a recycling joint \nventure. The company™s objective is to bundle the cable \ndismantling activities of Aurubis subsidiary CABLO and TSR. \nAurubis will hol˚\n % of the joint venture, which will go by the \nname of Cablo GmbH in the future. The review by the responsible \nmerger control authorities is expected to conclude in fiscal year \n˜˚˜˚/˜˛.\nThe Hamburg and Pirdop sites also process recycling raw \nmaterials. Though the primary smelters utilize copper \nconcentrates as their main feed material, they also use copper \nscrap to a certain extent because it is ideal for process cooling \nand therefore enables particularly energy-efficient processing.\nWe are one of ˜˜ national and international partners participating \nin the European research project ﬁFORCities Cooperating for \nCircular Economy.ﬂ The project™s goal is to develop new concepts \nto avoid and treat waste in the material streams related to plastic, \nbiomass, end-of-life electrical appliances, and wood. As a \nmultimetal recycler, Aurubis supports the project with its \nexpertise for the purpose of improving the recycling of strategic \nmetals (e.g., copper and gold) through the best possible collection \nand dismantling system for waste electrical and electronic \nequipment \n˚Glossary, page ˛˝\n. Aurubis and Stadtreinigung \nHamburg (the city of Hamburg™s municipal waste management \nservice) carried out a recycling project to investigate the \nadvantages of manual pre-dismantling compared to machine-\ndismantled devices. In a life cycle assessment comparing the two \nrecycling processes, manual dismantling is better when it comes \nto the impact categories related to environmental and resource \nprotection, from a purely ecological standpoint. Taking the time \nrequirement into account, however, ˛˚˚\n % manual pre-dismantling \nproved to be inefficient under the current conditions.

To us, compliance means that we follow laws and \nalign our actions with ethical principles, our values, and company \npolicies. In this context, compliance with all legal and company \nguidelines and policies is our objective. Violating the law can have \nserious consequenceor our employees, for Aurubis as a group, \nand for our business partners.\nThe company™s chief compliance officer is the central point of \ncontact for all compliance-relevant issues and reports directly to \nthe entire Executive Board. At the individual Group sites, local \ncompliance officers are available as a point of contact for \nemployees. Together with the Executive Board, our compliance \nemployees promote a compliance culture and actively strive to \nstrengthen awareness for following rules and laws in the Group.\nCompliance management establishes the main targets, develops \nthe corresponding organization, and identifies, analyzes, and \ncommunicates significant compliance risks. Our compliance \nprogram introduces principles and measures to limit risks and \nprevent violations. The chief compliance officer reports regularly \n(and as the circumstances may require) to the Executive Board \nand Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board with regard to the \ncompliance management system, compliance violations, and \ncompliance-related measures. He works closely with the \nemployees responsible for Risk Management and Internal Audit. \nWithin our internal control system, the chief compliance officer \nreviews potential compliance risks together with the Executive \nBoard, the plant managers, and the heads of corporate and central \nfunctions. As part of compliance management, the corruption \nrisks at our sites are also identified and documented by Risk \nManagement.\nSustainability\n\nThe compliance measures include prevention, monitoring, and \nsanctions. Preventive measures at Aurubis comprise the risk \nanalyses previously mentioned, internal policies, guidance, and \nparticularly the training of employees. The Corporate Anti-\nCorruption Compliance Policy and the Code of Conduct for \nemployees, both of which apply Group-wide, are at the core of \nour anti-corruption efforts.\n˛ Every employee receives the Aurubis \nCode of Conduct and confirms that it has been received by \nsigning the employment contract. Training on anti-corruption and \nantitrust law is carried out regularly throughout the Group.\nEmployees and business partners can make confidential and \nanonymous reports regarding legal violations and breaches of our \ncodes and standards via our Compliance Portal, the whistleblower \nhotline. The hotline is available in English, German, and Spanish \nand is open to all external stakeholders as well. It is operated by \nexternal, independent attorneys. \n˚<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aurubis.com/compliance/n">www.aurubis.com/compliance\n</a> Any \ntips they receive, for example regarding possible cases of \ncorruption, discrimination, or incidents in the supply chain, are \ninvestigated. If any wrongful acts are actually proven, they can \nlead to warnings, dismissals, and/or damage claims.\nKey measures\n» Providing employees for whom the topics of anti-corruption and \nantitrust law are relevant due to their responsibilities \n with training on these topics about every three years, regardless \nof their level in the company hierarchy\n In the past three years, this applied tˆ˘ employees for \n anti-corruption training and to ˙˙ employees for antitrust \n law training.\nKPI\nWe were not made aware of any antitrust or corruption cases \n in the reporting period.\n˛  The compliance approach of the Metallo sites acquired in ˜˚˜˚ fundamentally aligns \nwith that of Aurubis. Metallo™s final harmonization with Aurubis™ policies and \ncommitments is pending.\nSustainability\n\nLimited Assurance Report of the \nIndependent Auditor regarding the \n Separate Non-financial Group Report\nTo the Supervisory Board of Aurubis AG, Hamburg\nWe have performed an independent limited assurance \nengagement on the non-financial group report of Aurubis AG, \nHamburg (further —Aurubis.ﬁ) as well as the by reference qualified \nparts ﬂFoundations of the Groupﬂ and ﬁRisk and Opportunity \nReportﬂ of the Combined Management Report (further: —Reportﬁ) \naccording to §§ ˙˛ˆb, ˙˛ˆc in conjunction with ˜ˇ˝b to ˜ˇ˝e \nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) for the business year from \nOctober ˛, ˜˚˛˝ to September ˙˚, ˜˚˜˚.\nMANAGEMENT™S RESPONSIBILITY \nThe legal representatives of Aurubis. are responsible for the \npreparation of the Report in accordance with §§ ˙˛ˆb, ˙˛ˆc in \nconjunction with ˜ˇ˝b to ˜ˇ˝e HGB. \nThis responsibility of the legal representatives includes the \nselection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the \nReport and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual \ndisclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. \nFurthermore, this responsibility includes designing, implementing \nand maintaining systems and processes relevant for the \npreparation of the Report in a way that is free of Œ intended or \nunintended Œ material misstatements.\nINDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE ON THE \nPART OF THE AUDITING FIRM\nWe are independent from the entity in accordance with the \nrequirements of independence and quality assurance set out in \nlegal provisions and professional pronouncements and have \nfulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance with \nthese requirements.\nOur audit firm applies the national statutory provisions and \nprofessional pronouncements for quality assurance, in particular \nthe Professional Code for German Public Auditors and Chartered \nAccountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of \nthe German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschafts\n-prüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit \npractice (IDW QS ˛).\nPRACTITIONER™S RESPONSIBILITY\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Report based \non our work performed within our limited assurance engagement. \nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International \nStandard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) ˙˚˚˚ (Revised): \nﬁAssurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of \nHistorical Financial Informationﬂ published by IAASB. This \nStandard requires that we plan and perform the assurance \nengagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters \nhave come to our attention that cause us to believe that the \nReport of the entity for the business year October ˛, ˜˚˛˝ to \nSeptember ˙˚, ˜˚˜˚ has not been prepared, in all material \nrespects, in accordance with §§ ˙˛ˆb, ˙˛ˆc in conjunction with \n˜ˇ˝b to ˜ˇ˝e HGB. We do not, however, provide a separate \nconclusion for each disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement \nthe evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a \nreasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly less \nassurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. \nThe choice of audit procedures is subject to the auditor™s own \njudgement.\nSustainability\n\nWithin the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst \nothers the following assurance procedures:\n» Inquiries of personnel on corporate level, who are responsible \nfor the materiality analysis, in order to gain an understanding \nof the processes for determining material sustainability topics \nand respective reporting boundaries of Aurubis.\n» A risk analysis, including a media search, to identify relevant \ninformation on Aurubis. sustainability performance in the \nreporting period.\n» Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems \nand processes for determining, processing and monitoring \ndisclosures relating to environmental, employee and social \nmatters, respect for human rights, and combating corruption \nand bribery, including the consolidation of the data.\n» Inquiries of personnel on corporate level who are responsible \nfor determining disclosures on concepts, due diligence \nprocesses, results and risks, for conducting internal controls \nand consolidation of the disclosures.\n» Evaluation of selected internal and external documentation.\n» Analytical evaluation of data and trends of quantitative \ninformation which are reported by all sites for consolidation on \ncorporate level.\n» Evaluation of local data collection, validation and reporting \nprocesses as well as the reliability of reported data based on a \nsample of the site in Pirdop (Bulgaria).\n» Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, \nnothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that \nthe Report of Aurubis. for the business year from October ˛, ˜˚˛˝ \nto September ˙˚, ˜˚˜˚ is not prepared, in all material respects, in \naccordance with §§ ˙˛ˆb, ˙˛ˆc in conjunction with ˜ˇ˝b to ˜ˇ˝e \nHGB.\nRESTRICTION OF USECLAUSE ON GENERAL \nENGAGEMENT TERMS\nThis report is issued for purposes of the Supervisory Board of \nAurubis AG, Hamburg, only.

Amidst all these chang\n-es, BMW Brilliance recognised the need to shift \nand accelerate our approach to corporate respon\n-sibility as well. Thanks to resolute crisis manage\n-ment and rigorous digital teamwork at all levels, \nlast year we responded successfully to global cri\n-ses, committed to rethink our approach in the fu\n-ture, and reinforced our dedication to sustainability \nand responsible corporate citizenship. \nResponding to unprecedented challenges\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought immediate chal\n-lenges to our business and to the world. When COV\n-ID-19 first struck China, BMW Brilliance was one of the \nfirst automotive manufacturers to respond, offering \ntargeted donations and urgent assistance to the hard\n-est-hit areas. Moreover, with a workforce of 20,000 as \nwell as hundreds of thousands more people employed \nthroughout our value chain, protecting our people, \nour partners and stabilising the value chain became \nan immediate top priority. Throughout the year, and \nin the years to come, we will continue to support the \npeople and places most affected by this crisis. \nClimate change led to more-frequent extreme \nweather events across China and around the world \nin 2020, and governments made commitments \nthat will shape our business in the coming years. \nThe European Union submitted an updated and \nenhanced Nationally Determined Contribution with \na target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at \nleast 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels, while the Chi\n-nese government committed to achieving carbon \nneutrality by 2060. BMW Brilliance fully supports \nboth of these goals, and will continue to create \nworld-leading sustainable mobility technologies \nthat accelerate the world towards a greener future.\nRethinking our sustainability directions\nThe unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020, \nand the ways our company responded to those \nchallenges, have led us to view our approach to \ncorporate responsibility in new ways. In order to \nalign with the BMW Group™s new 2030 Sustaina\n-bility Strategy, as well as the stakeholder expecta\n-tions we uncovered through an engagement cam\n-paign in 2020, we have refined our sustainability \ndirections to the following three areas: climate \nchange actions; accountable, circular, and resilient \nvalue chain; and responsible corporate citizenship. \nReinforcing sustainability efforts across our \nvalue chain\nBy focusing our efforts on these three strategic di\n-rections, we can use our business to help address \nthe most pressing problems facing our industry, \nour society, and the world as a whole. \nOur climate change actions address the impactsŠ\nand the innovative solutions we have developedŠ\nof our products, our operations, and our supply \nchain. The first-ever BMW iX3, which premiered \nin 2020 in China, is a ground-breaking, all-electric \nvehicle produced exclusively by BMW Brilliance \nin Shenyang, using 100% renewable electricity, \nand shipped using low-carbon rail and sea logis\n-tics. This vehicle represents a true path forward \nfor sustainable mobility. And we have enhanced \nand expanded our NEV charging infrastructure, \nRESPOND, RETHINK, REINFORCE\n\n03so that our customers can now access more than \n300,000 public charging pillars across ChinaŠ\nhelping us achieve our goal of enabling zero-emis\n-sion long-distance travel. In 2020, we strength\n-ened our efforts in developing a low-carbon supply \nchain, partnering with suppliers that use renewa\n-ble energy and launching a Supply Chain Climate \nChange Initiative to help suppliers improve energy \nefficiency and CO\n˜ transparency. For aftersales \nand spare parts logistics, we increased our use of \nrail transport for imported spare parts from Europe \nto lower our carbon footprint further.\nWithin our own operations, BMW Brilliance is em\n-phasising resource efficiency and circularity. In \n2020, we achieved significant reductions in water \nand energy consumption per vehicle produced, as \nwell as in waste for disposal per vehicle produced. \nWorking alongside our manufacturing and recy\n-cling partners, we created our first closed-loop \nsystem for steel, while continuing to enhance our \nhigh-voltage battery recycling and parts remanu\n-facturing capabilities. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic showcased our emphasis \non responsible corporate citizenship. BMW Brilliance \ntook immediate, comprehensive action to safeguard \nthe health and safety of our employees, and worked \nclosely with business partners to cope with the chal\n-lenges we faced together. We also made timely, tar\n-geted financial and material contributions to support \nChinese society in the anti-pandemic battle. We ad\n-justed our flagship CSR programmes to meet the new \nnormal, using innovative solutions to continue our \nlong-term commitment to benefitting Chinese society.\nPriorities in 2021\nThe year of 2021 marks the beginning of China™s \n14th Five-Year Plan, which places a strong em\n-phasis on green, low-carbon, sustainable devel\n-opment. BMW Brilliance fully supports these sus\n-tainability commitments, and we are committed to \ndeveloping concrete targets for our updated sus\n-tainability directions, and continuing our support \nto the United Nations Global Compact and its Ten \nPrinciples. With a dedicated workforce, like-minded \npartners, and innovative technologies, our com\n-pany will stride towards our vision of becoming the \nleading sustainable provider of premium individual \nmobility in China™s automotive industry.\nDr. Johann Wieland\nPresident and CEO\nBMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\nﬁAt BMW Brilliance, we are proud to play a role in shaping \nthe future of mobilityŠa green, low-carbon, sustainable \nindividual mobility ecosystem."\n04\n2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\\n062020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\062020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\Q1: \nHow can next-generation \nproduction technologies contribute \nto a more efficient, circular, and \nlow-carbon value chain?\nQ2: \nIn the coming years, what role BMW \nBrilliance can play on the global \nstage and at home in China?\nQ3: \nHow is the electrification and \ndigitalisation of BMW Brilliance \nshaping the future of the company?\nQ4: \nAs we look to a post-COVID era in \nChina and around the world, what \nlessons do you think BMW Brilliance \nhas learned to support our employees?\nA1:\n  In 2020, and in the months and \nyears to come, we are integrating more \nadvanced manufacturing technologies \nand digital innovations to achieve an \nintelligent, efficient, and flexible produc\n-tion system producing highest quality \nproducts. These new technologies, \nsuch as big data, virtual reality, 5G, and \nAI solutions, will also help us achieve a \nlow-carbon value chain, which we can \naccelerate by optimising our energy us\n-age with energy-saving initiatives and \nby incorporating renewable electricity \nin our plants. By continually making our \noperations more efficient, we achieved \nsignificant reductions in water and en\n-ergy consumption per vehicle produced, \nas well as in waste for disposal per vehi\n-cle produced. BMW Brilliance has made \ngreat progress in building a circular \nvalue chain as well, maintaining 98% \nreusable packaging use for local parts \ntransportation and establishing a fully \ncircular model for steel in 2020. And \nwe are sharing our best practices with \nkey suppliers to help them establish \nCO˜ disclosure mechanisms and energy \nmanagement capabilities, to cascade \nsustainability into our value chain.\nFranz Decker\nSenior Vice President \nTechnology and Manufacturing\nA2: \nThe world premiere and export of \nthe first-ever BMW iX3 demonstrates \nour leadership in the future of mobility \nand the battery electric vehicle market. \nThe all-electric iX3 also represents our \ncommitment to green, sustainable de\n-velopment: A green car, built in a green \nplant, and transported using green \nlogistics. At the same time, the future of \nBMW Brilliance is firmly rooted in local \ndevelopment, as it has been since our \nfounding. In 2020, we contributed 38 \nbillion RMB in taxes, an 8.6% increase \nfrom 2019, and increased our local \ncontent purchasing volume in China by \n10.5%. In 2020 we produced our 3-mil\n-lionth vehicle in Shenyang, and made \nsignificant progress on our plant exten\n-sion projects , which will increase our \nproduction capacity in China and create \nmore jobs for the local community. We \nwill continue to expand our local supplier \nnetwork; to date we work with 400 local \ncontent suppliers here in China, as well \nas more than 1,000 indirect purchasing \nsuppliers. This localisation of our sup\n-ply chain reduces our environmental \nfootprint while increasing the economic \nbenefits we bring to our society.\nWang Jun\nSenior Vice President \nFinanceA3: \nGiven the climate commitments from \nthe BMW Group, the Chinese govern\n-ment, and countries around the globe, \nthere is no doubt that electrification is \ncentral to our future, and we are well-po\n-sitioned to play a leading role in shaping \nthe future of mobility. As well as growing \nour NEV dealer outlets in China to 495 \nlast year, an increase of 10% from 2019, \nwe also expanded the public charging \ninfrastructure our customers can access \nby 135.3% in 2020. Today, we offer more \nthan 300,000 public charging pillars \nacross China. And we continue to improve \nour recycling capabilities for high-voltage \nbatteries, with a 33.3% increase in 2020, \nwhile also developing innovative ways to \nreuse batteries whenever possible. The \nsustainability, convenience, and luxury we \noffer our customers is a result of our cus\n-tomer-centric focus on delivering a premi\n-um experience. In addition to continually \nimproving the safety and performance of \nour products, new digital solutions like the \nMy BMW app and digital integrations at \nBMW dealer outlets around the country \nimprove the customer experience, and \nour commitment to data privacy and com\n-pliance with the Cybersecurity Law of the \nPeople\'s Republic of China to ensure that \nour customers™ data remains protected.\nSean Green\nSenior Vice President \nSales and Marketing\nA4:\n Without a doubt, 2020 brought sig\n-nificant challenges to our company and \nour workforce. We learnedŠvery quick\n-lyŠthe value of prompt, transparent, \nand effective communication in order \nto keep our employees informed, con\n-nected, and engaged. We also achieved \nnew levels of service for our medical \nservices and employee benefits, while \nreimagining the ways we work to facili\n-tate efficient, secure, convenient remote \nwork. And while our total workforce \ngrew by 4.6% in 2020 to reach 20,739 \nemployees, we anticipate growing even \nfurther to meet demand for our products \nand the production capacities created by \nour new facilities. As a result, we remain \ncommitted to developing detailed plans \nfor advancing our workers™ careers, cre\n-ating clear succession plans for internal \npromotions, and enhancing our talent \nrecruitment efforts.

At \nBMW Brilliance, we faced \nuncertainty and extreme \ncomplexity, especially in the \nearly stages of the pan\n-demic. We are proud of the \nprompt and comprehensive \nresponses to the crisis we \nenacted for our employees, \nour business partners, and \nthe public. As we enter into \nthe post-pandemic era, \nBMW Brilliance always \nputs people first, so our \nimmediate response when \nthe pandemic struck was to \nprotect our workforce and \ntheir families. We quickly es\n-tablished a cross-functional, \ninternational Crisis Man\n-agement Team that con\n-vened twice daily to share \nthe latest updates, manage \nrisk, and provide holistic \nguidance. We kept in close \ncommunication with our \nworkforce through regular \nemail and JoyChat messag\n-es as well as around-the-\nclock HR Shared Services \nCentre hotline and health \nservice hotline. We offered \nonline doctor consultations \nthrough JoyChat, on-site \nhealth clinics at our plants, \nand regularly provided \nhealth and safety tips to all \nemployees. To protect our \non-site workers, we reor\n-ganised key aspects of the \nworkplace, including can\n-teen and shuttle bus con\n-figurations, and introduced \nmasks, thermometers, \nworkplace disinfection, and \nmandatory health reports \nfor all staff.\nThe pandemic provided us \nwith an immediate need to \nintensify collaboration with \nour key suppliers in order \nto ensure their continued \nproductivity and to sustain \nour operations. In order to \nensure the resilience of our \nsupply chain, we promptly \nlaunched an emergency \nrisk management plan to \nassess our inventory and \nlogistics for weaknesses, \nand work to reinforce those \noperations. We assessed \nthe production capacity of \nmore than 200 suppliers, \nhelped them adjust their \nproduction and logistics \nplans, and improve their \nown sourcing operations \nin order to ensure a stable \nparts supply for our busi\n-ness. As the early stages \nof the crisis passed, we \noffered suppliers strong \nsupport for their recovery \nefforts, including disease \nprevention materials and \ntechnical support. We are \ncommitted to continuing \nthese close, long-term \npartnerships with suppliers \nin coping with risks.\nOur dealers are critical busi\n-ness partners, and ensuring \ntheir continued success is \nvital to our business. We \nworked with our dealers to \nhelp stabilise their business \nin the early days of the pan\n-demic, and to maintain their \nongoing recovery. A suite of \nnew business policies were \ndesigned and implement\n-ed to support their work, \nincluding new vehicle sales \nand aftersales packages, \nfinancing support, and \nmore. We launched a new \nmobile app for dealers with \nreal-time audio-video tech\n-nology, enabling the devel\n-opment of a zero-contact \nauto show that increased \ncustomer engagement and \nboosted product sales. \nWe also upgraded our JOY \nLearning app to facilitate re\n-mote learning and increase \nour dealers™ business com\n-petitiveness. We continue to \nsupport our dealers during \ntheir reopening and recov\n-ery, providing health protec\n-tion guidelines, equipment, \nand technical support to \nensure their safety and the \nsafety of our customers. \nChina is the second home \nfor BMW, and we fully \nsupported China\'s pan\n-demic response. BMW \nwas one of the earliest \nglobal brands to announce \ndonations and assistance \nfor addressing the crisis, \nand BMW China and BMW \nBrilliance contributed three \nrounds of donations tar\n-geting the most immediate \nsocial needs. We directed \nfunds to purchase medical \nequipment and supplies \nfor hospitals in Wuhan, \nShenyang, and other cities, \nand we financed the na\n-tion™s first mental health \nand counselling hotline for \nfrontline medical personnel, \npatients, and volunteers. \nIn the post-pandemic era, \nwe will continue to advance \nthe innovative solutions \nwe created to continue our \nCSR programmes during \nthe crisis, and use those \ntools to reach more areas \nof Chinese society.\nwe believe the ways these \nresponses align with our \nlong-term perspectiveŠes\n-pecially how we accelerated \nour digitalisation transfor\n-mationŠwill be key ena\n-blers of our development as \nChina continues its recov\n-ery and its modernisation \njourney, while we remain \ncommitted to maintaining \neffective disease prevention \nand control measures to \nsafeguard our employees™ \nhealth and safety.\nEMPLOYEES\nSUPPLIERS\nDEALERS\nCHINESE SOCIETY\n24/7 IT helpdesk, HR and \nhealth service hotline\nHealth reports enabled \nby online tool\nSuppliers assessed for \nproduction capacity\nNew app to enable zero-\ncontact autoshow\nMedical supplies \npurchase for hospitals\nOnline doctor, regular \nhealth and safety tips\nDisease prevention and \ntechnical supports\nJOY Learning app upgrade \nto facilitate remote learning\nFirst mental health \ncounselling hotline for \nmedical personnel\nSocial distancing, \nworkplace disinfections \nand provision of health kits\nHealth protection \nguidelines, equipment \nand technical support\nCrisis Management Team \nmeeting 2x / day\nEmergency Risk \nManagement Plan\nNew policies to support \ndealership recovery \nRounds of donations \ntotalled 35 million RMB\nManagement support\nIT-enabled support\nHealth &amp; safety support\nFinancial support\n3200\n+11/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\n11/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nINTRODUCTION\nINTRODUCTION\n\n14\n1314\n13INTRODUCTION\n14\n2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\13/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nINTRODUCTION\n14\n2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\13/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nOUR SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS\nKEY PERFORMANCE ACROSS VALUE CHAIN\nWe launched the CO\n˜ emission transparency \npilot project and on-site \nenergy audit programme \nas part of the initiative to \nidentify carbon reduction \nopportunities across our \nsupplier network.\nClimate Change\nInitiative\nIn e-range\nThe new BMW 5 series \nplug-in hybrid with e-range \nextension incorporates \nour innovative battery \ntechnology and can travel \n95 km per charge in pure \nelectric mode, a 42% \nincrease over the previous \ngeneration.\n+42%In CO\n˚ emissions per \nvehicle produced\nWe reduced our CO\n˜ emissions per vehicle \nproduced by 7.5% from \n2019, to 0.18 t/vehicle in \n2020.

Emission factors \nof the supply chain and the disposal are based on the carbon footprints of representative vehicles from the product lines, calculated by Thinkstep™s LCA tool GaBi. \nEmissions factors of logistics are based on emission factors in DIN EN 16258. Emissions from the utilisation phase are calculated based on the average fleet emissions \nof automobiles delivered of BMW Brilliance and an average mileage of 150,000 km per vehicle. \n4. Including the generation of solar power electricity, the purchase of wind power electricity and International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs).\n5. Total non-hazardous waste consists of non-hazardous waste for recycling and non-hazardous waste for disposal. We improved the data calculation process in 2020, \nand there was increase in total non-hazardous waste for recycling over the previous year.\n6. Figures related to new employees from 2017 onwards are not directly comparable to figures from previous years due to changes in calculation method. New employees \nfigures before 2017 are those who joined BMW Brilliance during the year and still worked with BMW Brilliance at year-end. Figures from 2017 to 2020 are those who \njoined BMW Brilliance during the year, regardless of whether they still worked with BMW Brilliance at year-end or not.\n7. The increase of beneficiaries of BMW CSR activities is mainly due to more online activities in which the number of beneficiaries is counted by visiting times.\n8.

Sustainability is a \ncentral feature of the annual target-setting process through \nwhich business functions must set and deliver on concrete \ntargets, which allows us to implement the guidance of the \nBoard of Management in a systematic way, with accounta\n-bility for the business functions. The Board of Management \nis also responsible for ensuring compliance with all provi\n-sions of the law and internal regulations, as well as for ade\n-quate risk management and control. \nIn 2020, the Board of Management approved the imple\n-mentation of the BMW Brilliance Corporate Sustainability \nExecution Committee. This 9-member management-level \ngroup meets every month and is tasked with ensuring trans\n-parency and common understanding on overall sustainabil\n-ity progress, synergising resources across departments to \naccelerate implementation, and sharing external insights, \ntrends, and best practices to drive sustainability innovation.\nAt the day-to-day level, our internal business functions lead \nprogress on sustainability-related decisions made by the \nBoard of Management. This process is steered and mon\n-itored by Management Circles across business functions. \nThrough regular reviews, Management Circles ensure that \ndecisions from the Board of Management are translated \ninto actionable items with measurable targets and delivered \nto the operational level for implementation. \nCLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS \nClimate change is one of the most urgent crises facing \ngovernment, civil society, and stakeholders of all types. \nWe identify climate change-related risks and opportunities \nbased on four core areas: governance, strategic direction, \nrisk  management, and metrics and targets. \nŁ Governance: \nThe BMW Brilliance Board of Management \nis the highest entity with direct responsibility for cli\n-mate-related matters and ensures we integrate our stra\n-tegic directions on climate into all key business decisions.\nŁ Strategic Direction:\n Our climate  strategic direction is \nguided by the fact that, in the face of increasing regu\n-lationsŠas well as increased demand for low-carbon \nmobility solutionsŠcompanies that embrace sustaina\n-bility strategies and actions at an early stage will gain a \ncompetitive edge and greater market share. At the same \ntime, we face a number of potential risks, including transi\n-tion risks in the form of tighter emissions regulations, in\n-creased technology costs, changing consumer behaviour, \nand shifts in consumer preference. Some of the additional \nrisks that we are not alone in facing include extreme \nweather events and longer-term risks due to changes in \nwater availability. We are working to project the impacts \nof these and other climate-related risks and adjust our \nstrategic direction, business, and financial planning to \nmeet those risks head-on.\nŁ Risk Management:\n Our Controlling &amp; Risk Management \ndepartment function manages company-wide risks. Ma\n-terial risks reported by other department functions are \nreviewed and classified according to the likelihood and \nmagnitude of impact. We monitor all risks and opportuni\n-ties and identify methods to address each material risk, \nand incorporate those methodsŠincluding for climate-re\n-lated risksŠinto our company-wide risk management \nprocess.\nŁ Metrics and Targets: \nThe BMW Brilliance sustainability \nreport offers an overview of the key sustainability indi\n-cators that we use to measure, monitor, and manage \nclimate change-related risks. Because CO\n˜ emissions are \nof key significance for assessing climate-related issues, \nwe consider Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. \nWe have set climate change actions as a strategic sus\n-tainability direction, and our Corporate Sustainability Ex\n-ecution Committee is working across business functions \nto deliver climate-related targets across the whole value \nchain, including supply chain, production, logistics, utili\n-sation, and disposal.\nACCOUNTABLE, CIRCULAR AND RESILIENT \nVALUE CHAIN \nContinually improving our product quality and safety is cen\n-tral to our ongoing business success. Among the risks we \nseek to address and avoid include potential hazards to our \nemployees, customers, dealers, and suppliersŠas well as \nreputational damage from quality shortfalls. By achieving \nour high standards for quality, BMW Brilliance will attract \nand retain more customers and build brand loyalty that can \nsustain our business. These same risks and opportunities \nexist in our efforts to address and increase customer sup\n-port and satisfaction: By meeting customer desires and \nneeds, we can continue to grow our market presence while \nalso achieving global climate commitments.\nOur environmental, health, and safety (EHS) programme \naims to protect our workforceŠour most valuable resource. \nThe risks we work to eliminate include hazards to individu\n-als and the company from unsafe work practices and work \nenvironments, and by addressing these risks in a compre\n-hensive manner, we improve our performance, increase \nemployee satisfaction and retention, and attract top-quality \ntalent through our commitment to safety.\nWe manage our supply chain and key suppliers to mitigate \nrisks from raw material shortages and supply chain dis\n-ruptions, as well as reputational and regulatory risks from \nsourcing from conflict zones and regions at risk of forced la\n-bour and child labour. We achieve business benefits through \ndeveloping resilient and secondary sources for key raw \nmaterials and building stronger relationships with our key \nsuppliers that enable us to cascade corporate responsibility \nfurther into our supply chain. Increasing the circularity of our \nsupply chain helps us avoid risks of raw material shortages \nwhile providing the opportunities of reducing business costs \nand a lower CO\n˜ footprint from recycling and upcycling ma\n-terials.\nEach of these categories of risk management meets part \nof our overall value of accountability: By operating as a \nresponsible, ethical company, we can navigate the risks \nfrom failing to comply with laws and regulations, regulatory \npenalties for unfair or corrupt business practices, and repu\n-tational and legal risks from failing to protect customer and \ncorporate data. The opportunities from responsible corpo\n-rate citizenship are the ones that will sustain our business \nfor the long-term: trust from our employees, customers, and \nbusiness partners and a strong working relationship with \nregulatory authorities.\nRESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP\nExpectations for corporate behaviour are rapidly changing, and \npeople expect a company to work for the greater good more \nthan solely for profit. Our employeesŠcurrent and futureŠ\nexpect BMW Brilliance to support them in their personal and \nprofessional goals, and if we fail to do so, we run the risk of los\n-ing our competitive edge in recruiting the top talent. By building \na company culture that supports and values every employee, \nfrom a foundation of diversity, inclusion, and equality, we en\n-sure the dedication and loyalty of our employees and our cus\n-tomers, so we can continue to thrive and grow together.\nSustainability Governance at BMW Brilliance.\n\n26\n26\n1 / FUNDAMENTALS\n25/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\n25/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nCustomers\nGovernment\nCivil Society\nBusiness \nPartners\nLocal \nResidents\nShareholders\nEmployees\nMass Media\nOur \nstakeholder \nmapping.\nAs a company that delivers parts and products \naround the world, our operations impact the \nenvironment and affect a variety of stakehold\n-ers. And as a consumer-centric business, the \nviewpoints, decisions, and actions of our stake\n-holders have a decisive impact on the success \nof our enterprise. BMW Brilliance has always \nsought to ensure we live up to our stakehold\n-ers™ expectations, and when the world changed \ndramatically in 2020Šwith COVID-19, the \nglobal economic downturn, and China™s new \ncarbon commitments, among othersŠso did \nour approach. We conducted a new materiality \nassessment to determine up-to-date sustaina\n-bility priority issues and shape strategic direc\n-tions for the crucially important years to come. \nAn important part of this process required us to \nidentify our most-important and most-impacted \nstakeholders. Through industry research, liter\n-ature reviews, and a benchmarking exercise, \nwe considered the impacts of all the many envi\n-ronmental, economic, and regulatory changes \nthat had already taken place. The stakeholder \ntypes we identified in 2020 are: Customers, \nEmployees, Business Partners, Shareholders, \nLocal Residents, Government, Civil Society, \nand Mass Media.\nSTAKEHOLDER \nENGAGEMENT\n1.2\nDEFINING MATERIAL ISSUES\nSince our last materiality assessment in 2018, the world has undergone significant changes Œ not only \nwith COVID-19, but also the US-China trade war, Chinese government regulation and climate commit\n-ment changes, and more. As a result, our stakeholders™ expectations of our performance and strategy \nhave changed, so in 2020 we conducted a new materiality assessment to identify and prioritise the \nsustainability issues that matter most to our business and key stakeholders. The following steps pro\n-vide an overview of the process of our materiality assessment: \nDefining Issues\nWe began by listing 26 potential issues \ngrouped into five categories: \nŁ Product Responsibility\nŁ Corporate Governance \nŁ Environmental Protection\nŁ Work Environment and Culture\nŁ Society and Human Rights\nPrioritising Issues\nWe conducted an online survey with \n296 participants from a representative \ncross-section of our eight stakehold\n-er groups, followed by 12 in-depth \ninterviews with internal and external \nstakeholders. The result is a mate\n-riality matrix revealing the 14 issues \nconsidered most relevant to BMW Bril\n-liance as well as our stakeholders.\nSetting Directions\nWe then grouped the prioritised \nissues into three key directions as \nillustrated. Our Board of Management \nreviewed the results of our materiality \nanalysis to validate the importance of \neach topic, and upon validation, our \ncompany was able to begin crafting a \nstrategy to achieve successes within \neach of the key directions.\nResponsible Corporate Citizenship\nClimate Change Actions\nAccountable, Circular &amp; Resilient Value Chain\nOur materiality assessment process and matrix.\nRelevance for Stakeholders\nRelevance for BMW Brilliance\nModerate relevance\nHigh relevance\nHigh relevance\n  1245678910\n13111214\n151617181920212223\n2526\n243Product quality and safety\n  1Occupational health\nand safety\n2Information security and \nprivacy protection\n4Business ethics\n5Compliance, anti-corruption, \nand fair competition\n6GHG emissions and\nair pollution\n7Waste and effluents\n8Energy consumption and \nrenewable energy\n9Supply chain sustainability \nmanagement\n10\nEmployee development\nand well-being\n13Raw materials and \nparts lifecycle\n11Diversity, inclusion \nand equality\n12Customer support and \nsatisfaction\n3Electrification and \nsustainable product portfolio\n14\nEconomic performance\n15Human rights\n16Business transparency\n17Public policy\n18Risk and opportunities\non climate change\n19Collaboration and \npartnership\n20Water consumption\n21Automation and \ndigitalisation\n22Sustainable infrastructure\n23\nMobility service\n24Corporate citizenship and \ncommunity engagement\n25Land use and \nbiodiversity\n26\nProduct Responsibility\nCorporate Governance\nEnvironmental Protection\nWork Environment and Culture\nSociety and Human Rights\n˙˙\n281 / FUNDAMENTALS\n27/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\n27/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nCOMMUNICATING WITH OUR \nSTAKEHOLDERS\nWe incorporate sustainability issues \ninto our interactions with different \nstakeholder groups in a variety of \nways, with topics and formats that are \ntailored to each group. We strive to ad\n-dress critical issues and concerns in a \ntimely and transparent manner, and to \nanalyse current and coming expecta\n-tions in different areas of sustainabili\n-ty management. Engaging in dialogue \nwith stakeholders also means that we \ncan share our perspective on possible \nresponses and actions related to any \nchallenges, whether at the local, na\n-tional, or global levels.\nWe work closely with the government \non areas of mutual interest and coop\n-eration, such as local economic devel\n-opment and our green transformation. \nIn 2020, our President and CEO, Dr. \nJohann Wieland, participated in the \nEV100 Forum before the onset of the \npandemic, and met with members \nof the central government to discuss \nways that government policy can sup\n-port the growth of China™s NEV indus\n-try and market. As the pandemic came \nunder control, Dr. Wieland travelled \nto meet with leaders of the Shenyang \nCPC and the city of Shenyang to dis\n-cuss the region™s economic recovery \nand the role BMW Brilliance can play \nin helping continue the recovery. We \nwere invited to the second meeting \nof the China-Germany (Shenyang) \nHigh-end Equipment Manufacturing \nInnovation Committee focussed on \nthe theme of Opportunities and Chal\n-lenges for Sino-German Cooperation \nin Post COVID-19 era, and  we also \ntook part in the first-ever communica\n-tion workshop that brought together \nindustry and government to discuss \nthe progress and impacts of the new \nCybersecurity Law.\n With our business partners, we regu\n-larly engage in joint conversations to \nexplore the opportunities and chal\n-lenges we face together.

The Board \nof Directors (BoD) of BMW Brilliance \ntakes the ultimate accountability for \nadministering a compliance manage\n-ment system at the shareholder level. \nThe Audit and Compliance Committee \n(AC) under BoD is responsible for set\n-ting compliance objectives, allocating \nresources, and monitoring practices to \nensure compliance with regulatory and \nethical requirements. \nAuthorised by BoD, the Board of Man\n-agement of BMW Brilliance and BMW \nBrilliance Corporate Governance &amp; \nCompliance Committee (BCC) as its \nsub-committee, take the primary over\n-sight role. In 2020, BCC enlarged its \nscope from traditional compliance topics \nto the broader areas of Technical Com\n-Leadership exerts a fundamental in\n-fluence on our company culture. BMW \nBrilliance top management has played \nan active role in cultivating the compa\n-ny\'s compliance culture and inspiring \nit among all employees. In 2020, the \nclear Tone from the Top was constantly \ncommunicated and reinforced, reaching \nall levels through Executive Dialogues \nand communication letters, Compliance \nEvents, as well as the decisive discipli\n-nary actions around noncompliance. \nAt BMW Brilliance, the compliance \nresponsibility could not be delegated, \nand specific measurable compliance \ngoals have been assigned to the man\n-agement as mandatory targets and \nhave been integrated throughout the \nregular performance review process. \nMeanwhile, we ensure that compliance \nis not just the managers™ task, but the \nresponsibility of every employee. Each \nemployee is obliged to acknowledge \nand exercise the principle of respon\n-sibility, integrity and ethics in the daily \nwork, and when in doubt or having com\n-pliance concerns, each employee can \nat anytime access the SpeakUp Line to \nreport their concerns. \nCULTURE\nORGANISATION\nCompliance Governance at BMW Brilliance.\nCOMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT\n1.3\nBMW Brilliance is fully committed to \nlawful and responsible business con\n-duct. Through years of construction of \ncompliance infrastructure and foster\n-ing of compliance culture at the com\n-pany, BMW Brilliance has embedded \ncompliance value in all the main as\n-pects of the company™s operation, and \nin response to the increasingly com\n-plex and constantly evolving regulato\n-ry environment, the company has kept \nreviewing and adapting the manage\n-ment tools, measures and processes \nto ensure their effectiveness. Despite \nall the challenges and uncertainties \nthe company has faced in 2020, BMW \nBrilliance has managed to accomplish \nall the compliance management tar\n-gets and has provided a great level of \ncontinuity and certainty to employees, \nbusiness partners and stakeholders in \nterms of the company™s commitment \nin compliance. \n190,000\n+Views in "WeCompliance" \nin 2020.\n38,000\n+2020 web-based compliance \ntraining participants.\nIn response to the remote working and \nthe cessation of travel during COV\n-ID-19, we adopted technology tools , \nand accelerated the process automa\n-tion to transform the core compliance \nprocesses from offline to online. We \nlaunched ﬁWeComplianceﬂ account at \nmobile application to communicate the \nTone from the Top, compliance news \nclipping, case study, regulatory and \nenforcement updates to employees in \na timely manner. We also accelerated \nthe shift from classroom trainings to \nweb-based courses to enable em\n-ployees\' micro-learning anytime, any\n-where. A record of 20 courseware was \ndeveloped in 2020, covering a variety \nrange of compliance topics in general \ncompliance, anti-monopoly, conflict of \ninterests, safety and security, cyber\n-security, data privacy, export control, \ninformation protection, etc. \npliance, Safety and Security, Quality \nGovernance, and IT / Data Governance.\nOur compliance function and business \ndepartments collaborate closely to drive \nlawful and ethical behaviour and em\n-bedded values throughout the organisa\n-tion. The dedicated compliance function \nof Corporate Governance &amp; Compliance \ndepartment, as well as the broad com\n-pliance enablement departments such \nas Legal Affairs, Corporate Audit, Con\n-trolling and Risk Management, Taxes, \nCustoms and Export Control, provide \ncompliance assurance through super\n-vising business departments practices, \nand build partnership with them via \nproviding enablement and consultancy \nto protect the business from com\n-pliance risks. We have established a \ncomprehensive Compliance Operation \nNetwork, comprising of Compliance Re\n-sponsibles and Compliance Interfaces \nin all the business departments, to build \nthe compliance programmes into the \nbusiness operations. \nLawful and ethical conduct \nforms the basis of what we \ndo as a company, defines our \ncompany™s image in the eyes \nof the general public, and helps \ncreate trust in our brands, \nproducts, and services.\n˝G\nTONE FROM THE TOP\nTone from the Top speech delivered by Dr. Wieland to all employees.\n\n3231Technology changes life, as well as the compliance \nmanagement in BMW Brilliance. More systematic \nsolutions have been developed, localised or up\n-graded, to continuously improve the effectiveness in \npreventive and detective control on compliance man\n-agement and daily business management.\nWHISTLE˜BLOWER MECHANISM AND \nREMEDIATION\nWe offer a number of channels through which em\n-ployees, suppliers, and business partners can report \npossible compliance violations or raise compliance \nconcerns, and give reporters the right to remain \nanonymous. We continuously promote the reporting \nchannels, and constantly encourage employees and \nstakeholders to speak up when they are aware of or \nsuspect potential misconducts. We prohibit retalia\n-tion, employees will not suffer adverse consequenc\n-es or retaliation for refusing to do things that violate \nlaws and regulations, or for raising a concern about \npotential misconduct in good faith. When receiving a \nconcern or issue, a dedicated team will evaluate and \nfollow up it in a serious, fair, and prompt manner. We \npractice ﬁZero Toleranceﬂ for any non-compliance. \nWhere possible, compliance violations are investi\n-gated and substantiated, we report them, take ap\n-propriate remedial actions, and document the out\n-comes. Moreover, we resolve the root causes and \nenhance our controls and processes to minimise the \nrisk of recurrence. \n2021 OUTLOOK\nIn parallel with all the internal compliance ef\n-forts, BMW Brilliance has devoted to cultivating \ncompliance culture across the entire value chain. \nWith the world™s recovery from the pandemic, \nBMW Brilliance is planning more proactive and \npractical steps to foster business partners™ \nengagement in compliance management. In \naddition to Supplier On-board Evaluation and \nthe contractual provisions under purchasing and \ndealership agreements with respect to the par\n-ties™ compliance obligations, more specific advo\n-cacies and initiatives will be made by means of \nprogrammes such as Social Responsibility Code \nof Conduct, spot check and enhancing external \ncompliance communication with suppliers and \ndealers.\nAiming to transform into a high-tech company, \nBMW Brilliance has reached out into multiple \nnew business areas. It is a clear goal to engrave \nthe compliance value into all the new subsid\n-iaries and business units, and enable them to \nimplement the same level of compliance stand\n-ard. Measures have been taken in setting up a \nstable and competent compliance network and \nempowering the new community constantly to \nmake it function effectively.\nAdapting to the rapidly growing business, BMW \nBrilliance keeps seeking innovative and dynamic \napplication of IT tools in compliance management. \nTake the E-chop System for instance, with the re\n-lentless joint endeavour, the E-chop System has \nbeen put into pilot use in 2020. With the progres\n-sive application of more functions on the System, \nit will not only benefit BMW Brilliance in multiple \nmanagerial aspects, but will significantly prompt \nthe effective interaction with the massive amount of \nbusiness partners. \nWith the world entering into an era of Big Data, \nBMW Brilliance embarks on better utilising the com\n-pany™s digital assets in compliance management. \nOn the unfolding blueprint of E-compliance, more \nsystematic tools will be deployed in integrating re\n-sources, detecting and preventing non-compliance, \nidentifying and analysing potential risks, raising \ncompliance awareness and elevating the compa\n-ny™s compliance infrastructure to the next level.\nLeveraging on our refined sustainability strategic \ndirections, we will develop our sustainability targets \nand integrate into corporate governance, advance \ncommunication and collaboration with stakehold\n-ers, and enhance the overall awareness and level of \nsustainable development of the company.\nLEGAL COMPLIANCE CODE, POLICIES, TRAININGS AND COMMUNICATION\nThe BMW Brilliance Legal Compliance Code which sets basic values, rules and stand\n-ards that all employees are required to adhere to, forms the foundation of compliance \nmanagement. To facilitate the company™s compliance with applicable laws, regulations \nand standards, we have formulated the company specific policies and instructions to \nguide employees\' daily work. Diversified initiatives, including trainings, campaigns, \nand communication programmes, are provided to employees to advocate employees™ \nawareness.\nTo highlight the company™s core value of compliance from the first day of employment at \nBMW Brilliance, the Legal Compliance Code has been integrated into the HR recruiting \nprocess. All new associates are required to read through the Legal Compliance Code \ncarefully, acknowledge the core value that compliance is the personal responsibility of \neach employee, and make a commitment to adhere to it. After on-boarding, ongoing com\n-pliance trainings are provided to help them deepen their understanding of the company™s \ncompliance processes, policies and regulations and practice them in their daily works. \nMANAGING COMPLIANCE RISKS AND SOCIAL CREDIT STATUS\nIt is essential to closely monitor the external and internal environment in a compre\n-hensive and timely manner. A multi-dimensional monitoring mechanism has been \nestablished at BMW Brilliance, comprised of daily monitoring on the updates to leg\n-islations and enforcement, monthly tracking of public social credit records and yearly \nCompliance Risk Assessment project. This combination of bottom-up monitoring and \na central steering mechanism has enabled BMW Brilliance to obtain a full picture of the \ncompany™s compliance risks, understand respective risk sources  and consequences \nof identified risks, implement targeted preventive and corrective actions, and focus our \nattention and resources on higher-priority risks.\nIn response to the Chinese Government™s administrative transition toward a cred\n-it-based regulatory mechanism, we have optimised our internal Social Credit System \nmanagement mechanism by implementing proactive credit supervision, aiming to de\n-tect and prevent at the earliest stages any bad entries that may affect BMW Brilliance™s \nsocial credit status. By the end of 2020, BMW Brilliance received several top-ranking \nhonours at different business areas.\nMONITORING AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\nOn a daily basis, we monitor, analyse, and follow laws, regulations, industrial policies, \nenforcement trends and best practices. The monitoring departments make in-depth \nanalysis as to the significance and impact of any changes and propose action plans if \nneeded. Based on the monitoring and analysis, compliance reminders are communicat\n-ed to all associates to ensure widespread awareness. \nMEASURES\n11,000\n+Online Compliance Quiz \nparticipants in 2020.\n100\n%2020 compliance on-boarding \ntraining participation rate.\nA Level\nState Taxation Administration\nA Level\nState Administration of \nForeign Exchange\nA Level\nChina Quality Certification \nCentre\nA Level\nMinistry of Human Resources \nand Social Security\nAdvanced AEO\nGeneral Administration of \nCustoms\nHonest Entity\nMinistry of Ecology and \nEnvironment\nBMW Brilliance Honour List \nat Social Credit System.\nTAX\nHR\n342020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\33/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nCLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS\n2.1  /  CLIMATE˚FRIENDLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n2.2 /  GREEN PRODUCTION\n2.3 /  SUPPLY CHAIN CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS\n2.4 /  GREEN LOGISTICS\n0216.3\n%Percentage of customer support parts \nimported by rail (up from 8.3% in 2019)\n˜7.4\n%Reduction in energy consumption\nper vehicle produced\n100\n%Renewable electricity used in \nShenyang production base since 2019\n˜51.3\n%Reduction in \n    CO \n˜ emissions per unit\nfor outbound logistics since \n2014\n˜7.5\n%Reduction in CO\n2 emissions \nper vehicle produced\n300,000\n+Public charging pillars accessible to\n BMW customers across China\nBMW \niX3World premiere and first-ever all-electric \nvehicle exported to the global market\nLEED WAREHOUSE\nNew Spare Parts Distribution Centres \nin Hefei, Beijing and Ningbo \n50%Percentage of aluminium ingot production that has shifted \nto using renewable electricity for BMW Brilliance products\n495\nNumber of NEV \ndealer outlets in China\nTAKING PROACTIVE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS \nACROSS VALUE CHAIN IS CRUCIAL TO OUR FUTURE.\n\n362 / CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS\n35\n/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nLowering lifecycle CO\n˛ emissions \nper vehicle by at least\ncompared to 2019.\ncompared to 2019.\ncompared to 2019.\ncompared to 2019.\nReducing production CO\n˛ emissions \nper vehicle by\nReducing use-phase CO\n˛ emissions \nper vehicle by more than\nReducing supply chain CO\n˛ emissions \nper vehicle by at least\n1/3\n80\n%40%20%We are in the process of developing our CO\n˜ reduction targets that align and contrib\n-ute to the BMW Group\'s 2030 climate commitment.

In \n2020, our associates submitted 21 measures to the \nplatform, which will result in a combined savings \nof 6,649 MWh of energy use per year. One of the \nhigh-impact examples was a suggestion for mak\n-ing our powertrain washing process more efficient \nby better controlling the frequency of washes and \ncapturing and recycling the hot steam. This change \nmakes the process 40% more efficient, and can \nsave as much as 3,582 MWh of energy use per \nyear. Another solution came from improving the \nair supply unit of the paint shop in Plant Dadong. \nBy shutting down the air supply unit in the facility™s \noffice area overnight, then preheating and cycling \nthe air into the paint shop oven, we estimate that \n812 MWh of energy can be saved per year. As we \ndevelop and build new plants, we are using advan\n-tage technology to save 12 Bar of compressed air. \n\n482 / CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS\n47/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nRENEWABLE ENERGY USE\nThe BMW Group has set a 2020 target of sourcing \nall external electricity from renewable sources for \nits worldwide production plants. BMW Brilliance \nfully achieved this goal in 2019 at our production \nbase in Shenyang, and we continue to optimise \nour renewable energy portfolio while also explor\n-ing other clean energy alternatives. \nIn 2020, we maintained 100% renewable elec\n-tricity at our production plants, with on-site solar \npower, wind power and International Renewable \nElectricity Certificates. As we continue building \nthe Tiexi New Plant and Plant Dadong Extension \nprojects, we estimate the solar photovoltaic sys\n-tems installed there will quadruple our renewable \nelectricity generation capacity, resulting in further \nCO˜ reductions.\nWe are developing an alternative energy roadmap \nto help us explore additional alternative energy \noptions, such as wind power and biomass gas.\nSUPPLY CHAIN \nCLIMATE CHANGE \nACTIONS\nIn 2020, the BMW Group became the first automobile man\n-ufacturer to set concrete targets for reducing CO\n˜ emissions \nfrom its supply chain, with a 2030 goal of at least 20% lower \nsupply chain emissions per vehicle from 2019 levels. In addi\n-tion, the BMW Group has committed to only using electricity \nfrom renewable sources for all of its battery manufacturing, \nwhich will save an estimated 10 million t of CO\n˜ by 2030. \nBMW Brilliance has already begun laying the foundations of \nour own low-carbon supply chain transformation to support \nthe BMW Group™s 2030 target as well as the Chinese gov\n-ernment™s carbon-neutral commitment. Our newly launched \nSupply Chain Climate Change Initiative will identify the most \neffective levers in our supplier network to reduce CO\n˜ emis\n-sions, and will improve our transparency on CO\n˜ emissions \ndisclosures and reporting.\n2.3\nSince the end of 2019, \nwe have switched to 100% \nrenewable electricity at our \nShenyang production base.  \nOur next goal is to achieve \ncarbon-neutral production, \nas part of the BMW Group\'s \nclimate commitment. \nRenewable electricity\n100\n%Production\nCARBON\nNEUTRAL\n2019\n2020\nFuture\nProduction system at the workshop of CATL, HVB cell supplier of BMW Brilliance.\n\n5049LINES OF ACTION TOWARDS A LOW˜CARBON SUPPLY CHAIN\nWe have identified three initial approaches to ac\n-celerate our shift to a low-carbon supply chain. \nWe are working with our suppliers to identify and \nimplement energy efficiency and energy-saving \nmeasures. As part of that process, we are also \nhelping improve their data quality and promot\n-ing the CO\n˜ transparency, so we can confidently \nmeasure their emissions and track improvements. \nWith these focus areas as a backdrop, our Supply \nChain Climate Change Initiative is helping us lay \nthe groundwork to scale up these actions by iden\n-SUPPLY CHAIN CLIMATE \nCHANGE INITIATIVE: BUILDING \nA SOLID CORNERSTONE\nOver the course of the year, BMW Brilliance made \nprogress on increasing our supply chain CO\n˜ emis\n-sions transparency. As a pilot project, we developed \ncustomised toolkits and offered one-on-one trainings \nto support our suppliers in disclosing their carbon \nemissions data on the 3\nrd party platform. We enrolled \n20 suppliers in this 2020 pilot project, who have been \nwell prepared for further improving CO\n˜ emissions \ntransparency in 2021 as well as for the future.\nA key aspect of our supply chain emissions work \nin 2020 included helping our suppliers evaluate \ntheir energy consumption practices and identify \n2021 OUTLOOK\nBMW Brilliance will continue to explore the poten\n-tial of clean energy to accelerate the low-carbon \ntransformation of our supply chain. A China sus\n-tainability management project team will be set up, \nwith more intensive focus on building a low-carbon \nsupply chain. We will fully roll out our supply chain \nCO˜ emission transparency project and engage \nmore suppliers in disclosing their CO\n˜ emissions. \nWe will also initiate CO\n˜ target-setting process \ntifying CO\n˜ emissions hotspots across our Tier-1 \nto N-Tier supplier network, exploring the oppor\n-tunities for carbon reductions, and strengthening \nour suppliers™ awareness of and capability for \nCO˜ disclosures through training and sharing best \npractices. To date, we have included in this initi\n-ative representatives from suppliers in our most \nenergy-intensive industries and key geographies \nacross our supplier network, to develop a better \noverview of the potential areas for improvement in \nthe supply chain.\nfor supplier nomination to encourage suppliers to \nprepare for long-term CO\n˜ reduction strategy and \nactivities. As we continue to advance our under\n-standing, we will share our experiences and best \npractices across our supply chain to mobilise even \nmore suppliers to achieve green production. These \nefforts will help ensure the achievement of the \nBMW Group™s overall sustainability target, as well \nas promote the implementation of China™s sustain\n-ability strategy across the supply chain.\nopportunities to improve their energy efficiency \nand reduce emissions. We partnered with 20 se\n-lected Tier-1 and Tier-2 suppliers and conducted \non-site audits with third-party professionals. After \nprocessing the results of the audit, we provided \neach supplier with a summary report and a list \nof measures to improve efficiency and reduce \nemissions, including management improvement, \nequipment upgrades, process optimisation, and \nawareness-raising.\nEXPANDING RENEWABLE ENERGY USE \nAND BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS IN CLIMATE \nACTION\nAs part of our efforts to green our supply chain, we \nalso began considering our raw material suppliers™ \nrenewable energy use as one factor for deciding if \nwe enter into a new contract with them or extend an \nexisting contract. By transparently including renew\n-able energy as a criterion for doing business with \nour suppliers, we are motivating them to achieve \ngreen production and reduce CO\n˜ emissions.\nIn 2020 nomination, our aluminium ingot supplier, \nwhich accounts for 50% of BMW Brilliance™s alumin\n-ium ingot, has completed its shift to renewable elec\n-tricity for BMW Brilliance products. The supplier had \nsuccessfully utilised renewable electricity in the up\n-stream aluminium electrolysis process and ingot pro\n-duction, and will reduce its emissions by 0.36 million \nt of CO\n˜ equivalent in the contract period 2021-2023. \nSOURCING ALUMINIUM INGOT \nPRODUCED BY GREEN ELECTRICITY\n"It is crucial to partner with \nsuppliers to bring down carbon \nfootprints in our supply chain."\n Š message from BMW Brilliance shareholder\n\n5251GREEN LOGISTICS\nAs we work to achieve the BMW Group™s 2030 \nsustainability goals, as well as the Chinese gov\n-ernment™s carbon neutrality commitment, BMW \nBrilliance is committed to low-carbon processes \nacross all of our logistics flows. \nOur logistics operations span the country and the \nworld, and managing them is a complex operation. \nWe are targeting all three of our primary logistics \noperations in our sustainability work: inbound \n2.4\nEXPANDING LOW˜CARBON TRANSPORTATION MODES\nRAILWAY˜TO˜RAILWAY TO THE WEST\nBMW Brilliance has been continually expanding the \nproportion of low-carbon modes of transportation, \nemphasising multi-modal operations to reduce our \nCO˜ emissions. We achieved a major milestone in \nJuly 2020 when we successfully launched our rail\n-way-to-railway project, which now delivers finished \nvehicles from Xi™an™s Xinzhu train station to Urumqi \ntrain station. The ﬁlast mileﬂ delivery of finished vehi\n-cles to Urumqi and Lhasa direction, conventionally by \nroad freight with a 2,000+ km haulage, is now cov\n-ered by our railway network. By extending trunk-rail\n-way transportation and eliminating the need for trucks \nalong the 2,000 km delivery route, we are bringing \ntangible CO\n˜ savings while improving the stability, se\n-curity, and efficiency of our logistics operations. \nAs a result of these improvements to our outbound \nlogistics, we are now transporting 78% of our finished \nvehicles wholly or partially by rail, which has reduced \nour CO\n˜ emissions by 51.3% per unit since 2014.\nTO THE WORLD THROUGH DALIAN PORT\nWith the world premiere of the all-new BMW iX3 \nNEV in 2020, we have been prioritising the use \nof low-carbon transportation options as we begin \nexporting the innovative vehicle around the world. \nWe selected the port of Dalian as one of the key \nexport partners: Because the facility is in the same \nprovince as our Shenyang plants, we are signif\n-icantly reducing the transportation distance and \nCO\n˜ emissions for the first stage of our outbound \nlogistics for the \nBMW iX3.\nCustomer support logistics represent a carbon-in\n-tensive aspect of our supply chain: The majority of \nour spare parts are imported from Europe, with air \nand sea transport still being the primary modes of \nshipping for these deliveries. We are dramatically \nincreasing our use of rail transport for these ship\n-ments: In 2020, 16.3% of our imported spare parts \nwere transported by rail, up from 8.3% in 2019. \nWAREHOUSE PLANNING OPTIMISATION\nWe are also optimising our warehouse operations \nwith more advance planning through Leading Ware\n-house Project, allowing us to maintain a reserve of \nslow-moving spare parts for which we sometimes \nreceive urgent requests. By keeping a stock in our \nwarehouses at the Shanghai Spare Parts Distribu\n-tion Centre, we are better able to avoid importing \nitems from abroad unnecessarily and inefficiently. \nAs we continue to improve the flexibility of our parts \ndistribution among our local Spare Parts Distribu\n-tion Centres, we will be able to minimise air trans\n-port needs for the urgent parts requests.\nlogistics, getting materials from our suppliers to \nour manufacturing bases; outbound logistics, \nsending finished vehicles from plants to consum\n-ers; and customer support logistics, delivering \nspare parts from Spare Parts Distribution Centres \nto dealerships. To achieve a lighter environmental \nfootprint, we are embracing multi-modal transpor\n-tation, adopting innovative low-carbon vehicles \nand fuels and greener warehouses, and applying a \ndigital approach to streamline our operations. \nExport of the all-new BMW iX3 from Dalian Port.\n78\n%of our finished vehicles \nare wholly or partially \ntransported by rail.\n˜51.3\n%Reduction in CO\n˛ emissions \nper unit for outbound \nlogistics since 2014.\n16.3\n%of our imported spare \nparts are transported by \nrail, up from 8.3% in 2019.\n2,000\nKM\n+haulage to Urumqi and \nLhasa is now covered by \nour railway network.\nAvoid unnecessary \nimports from abroad \nfor urgent requests. \nWAREHOUSE \nOPTIMISATION\n\n5453OPTIMISING \nLOGISTICS PLANNING\nINNOVATING ON \nTRANSPORTATION VEHICLES\nPARCEL TRAIN PROJECT\nIn 2020, BMW Brilliance built our pilot ﬁparcel trainﬂ pro\n-ject from 2019 into our routine operations. This innovative \napproach to rail transport allows parcels of variable dimen\n-sions to be transported together in one container, allowing \nour logistics service providers to fill containers more effi\n-ciently and maximise the use of space. In our first year of full \noperations in 2020, approximately 10% of the total parcel \nvolume transported from the Greater Shanghai region to our \nShenyang production base utilised the parcel train model. \n"MILK˜RUN" ROUTE PLANNING\nFor our customer support logistics, we are working to mini\n-mise the distances when delivering spare parts. We are de\n-veloping a milk-run route planning approach to holistically \nconsider distance, timeliness, payloads, and vehicles to de\n-liver parts to dealerships within certain range. In the future, \nwe will increasingly localise our spare parts supplies, so that \nwe can cut down on our international transportation needs.\nEXPANDING THE USE OF E˜TRUCKS\n Just as electric vehicles are making personal transport \ncleaner, we are working to develop electric vehicles that can \nchange how we deliver our products. In 2020, we began \ncollaborating with truck manufacturers and logistics service \nproviders on a trial of battery-powered E-trucks in our Da\n-dong Plant Dispatch Areas (PDAs). Another pilot project in \nFoshan leveraged E-trucks to transport spare parts from \nour Spare Parts Distribution Centres to dealerships. We \nare also trialling the use of E-trucks for in-plant transport: \nAt Plant Dadong, a fleet of these E-trucks are providing \nlow-carbon transport for materials and parts over the short \ndistances to production workshops.\nUSING LNG FOR HEAVY TRUCKS\nIn addition to battery-powered trucks, we are conducting a \nfeasibility study to identify the potential benefits and chal\n-lenges to using liquefied natural gas (LNG) trucks in our \nlogistics operations. In 2020, we rolled out an LNG truck pi\n-lot programme in some of our Decentralised Dispatch Area \n(DDA) cities to help us better understand the opportunities. \nWhile LNG fuel promises a lower carbon footprint than die\n-sel, we have identified a number of challenges, including \nunpredictable prices for LNG, a shortage of fuel and main\n-tenance stations for LNG vehicles, differing documentation \nneeds for annual LNG truck reviews, and reduced carrying \ncapacity due to the location of the gas tank. We are current\n-ly working with truck and trailer producers to explore opti\n-mising the gas-tank position to increase payload capacity.\nGREENING OUR \nWAREHOUSES\nBMW Brilliance™s Spare Parts Distribution Centres in He\n-fei, Beijing, and Ningbo are designed in alignment with the \nLEED Green Building Standard, which will significantly \nreduce our energy use and improve our renewable energy \nuse, dramatically shrinking our carbon footprint. And we \nare currently upgrading and rebuilding our warehouses to \nimprove the efficiency of our storage utilisation and reduce \noverall energy consumption.\nSAVING ENERGY VIA ACTIVE MEASURES\nWe are also working with our logistics operators at our DDAs \nto measure and report their energy and water consumption \nand set water consumption targets to raise awareness of \nresource use and encourage better conservation practic\n-es. Our warehouse in the Zhengzhou DDA has installed \na water recycling system that saved 20,409 L of water in \n2020 alone. Our Plant Tiexi PDA monitors their electricity \nconsumption and the Block C area reduced electricity use in \n2020 by 14,743 kWh over 2019 consumption. And our ware\n-house in Dalian Port was designed to incorporate natural \nlighting through skylights and transparent lighting belts. By \nusing natural light for the facility 10 hours per day, we have \ncalculated that the facility is saving 180,000 kWh of electric\n-ity use every year.\n2021 OUTLOOK\nWe will continue to improve the energy efficiency \nand reduce the CO\n˜ emissions for all of our logistics \nflows. For our  physical logistics, we are piloting \na programme to reuse secondary HVBs for pallet \ntrucks in our plants. In collaboration with our busi\n-ness partners, we have developed rigid process \nto assess, select, and reassemble HVBs that are \nretired from a BMW vehicle to the same degree of \nsafety and functionality, and repurpose for powering \nthe smaller warehouse vehicles, thereby extending \nthe lifespan of our HVBs and making the most use of \nour battery technology.\nOur outbound logistics work will focus on further \nutilising clean energy trucks in the coming year. We \nwill put more LNG trucks into use, and roll them out \nfor use in additional DDA cities. We will work in close \ncollaboration with heavy truck/trailer manufactur\n-ers and logistics service providers to develop heavy \ntrucks powered by LNG and battery.\nFor our customer support logistics, in 2021 our Spare \nParts Distribution Centre in Hefei will go live, bringing \nmore potential for optimising delivery networks and \nfurther reducing CO\n˜ emissions. We will continue to ex\n-plore opportunities with our logistics partners to bring \nmore new energy vehicles into our fleet by specifying \nour preference for NEVs in our service requirement.\nWe are piloting the use \nof E-trucks in various \nscenarios - for our in-plant \ntransportation; at our Plant \nDispatch Areas, and in our \ncustomer support parts \ndelivery,  as our attempt to \ngreen our logistic fleets.\n10% of our total parcel \nvolume from the Greater \nShanghai region is now \ntransported to Shenyang \nwith the Parcel Train \nmodel, cutting more CO\n˛ emissions from efficiency \nimprovement.\nOur new warehouse in Dalian Port equipped with natural light belts.\nDIGITALISED MANAGEMENT APPROACH\nPart of our efforts to streamline logistics involves making our \nvehicle distribution management (VDM) system more effi\n-cient. We are developing new modules to enable real-time \nmonitoring and CO\n˜ emissions calculations for distribution \nroutes in our outbound logistics network. By adopting a digi\n-tal-first approach, our dealers have visibility into what vehicles \nare available and the distribution status of the vehicles they \nhave already ordered; we are also able to reduce our paper use \nby eliminating paper distribution labels and handover sheets.\n\n562020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\55/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\n55ACCOUNTABLE, CIRCULAR \n&amp;RESILIENT VALUE CHAIN\nPRODUCT AND SERVICE QUALITY  /  3.1\nCIRCULARITY  /  3.2\nRESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH &amp; SAFETY MANAGEMENT  /  3.3\nBUSINESS ACCOUNTABILITY  /  3.4\n03564,347\nPieces of HVB recycled in 2020, \nwith a total weight of  98,261 kg\n˜17.9\n%Reduction in water consumption per vehicle produced\n˜47.1\n%Reduction in accident frequency rate (AFR)\n108,070\nNumber of parts collected for remanufacturing in \n2020,  with a total weight of over 669 t\n˜3.8\n%Reduction in VOC emissions per vehicle produced\nC-NCAP rating scored by the \nall-new BMW 3 Series\n+Establishment of the 1st closed-loop system for \nsteel, with 45,000 t recycled in the loop in 2020.\nSTEEL\nA GREAT COMPANY IS ABOUT TAKING \nRESPONSIBILITY BEYOND ONE™S OWN AREA.\n\n58573 / ACCOUNTABLE, CIRCULAR AND RESILIENT VALUE CHAIN\n57/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nA˛responsibleŠand sustainableŠ\ncompany \nmust take into account the \nimpacts of its operations on people and the \nplanet, from the beginning of its supply chain \nto the end of life of its products.

And \nas our business, and the country, becomes \nincreasingly digital, we are committed to \nindustry-leading data privacy and information \nsecurity practices.\nPRODUCT AND \nSERVICE QUALITY\nEverything we do at BMW Brilliance is driven by \na desire for premium qualityŠand that premium \nquality includes not only best-in-class products and \nservices intended for individual mobility, but also a \ncontinual focus on the customer. Customer satisfac\n-tion is one of BMW Brilliance™s top priorities, and we \nhave created a customer-centric experience at every \nsingle touchpoint of the customer journey.\n3.1\nTOTAL QUALITY \nMANAGEMENT\nˆ QUALITY NUMBER ONE ˇ \nOur quality strategy is called Quality Number ONE, \nand it expresses our claim to leading within the \npremium mobility market. We believe in leading by \ntaking responsibility and ownership to exceed cus\n-tomers™ expectations. Our core values shape our \nbehaviour guidelines, which support company efforts \nto live our quality policy every day.\nQUALITY MANAGEMENT AT BMW BRILLIANCE\nThe BMW Brilliance quality governance structure con\n-sists of three lines of defence: The first line is made \nup of internal controls and the business department, \nfollowed by a comprehensive group of Compliance, \nQuality Management, Risk Management, Controlling, \nSecurity, and others to make up the second line of de\n-fence; the third line of defence consists of our Corpo\n-rate Audit team. Each of these groups reports to our \nBoard of Management, and the Corporate Audit team \nalso reports to our Supervisory Board.\nThe BMW Brilliance Quality Circle for Quality \nManagement System (QC QMS) was launched in \n2020 to maintain and improve our overall quality \nmanagement systems based on the ISO 9001 and \nIATF 16949 quality management systems. This \nseven-member panel consists of senior leader\n-ship, including our Head of Corporate Quality. The \nQuality Circle meets regularly throughout the year \nto assess progress towards our quality targets. \nThe continuous improvement approach is the core \nelement that shapes our quality targets. BMW \nBrilliance quality targets cascade down from top \nmanagement to frontline associates based on long-\nterm company objectives, defined by indicators \nnecessary to measure achievement of that target, \nand understanding the value of achieving that tar\n-get. Teams shape the goals in three-level meetings, \nestablishing responsibilities and identifying subse\n-quent review meetings to ensure that the company \nremains on track to achieve those targets. \nA QUALITY˜FIRST MINDSET\nIn order to consistently achieve the targets set \nby company leadership, we have developed a \ncomprehensive set of quality-related trainings \ndesigned to foster a quality-first mindset. The cor\n-porate-level Product Safety &amp; Conformity online \ntraining spotlights the most crucial aspects of our \nquality work: People™s health and safety must not \nbe endangered by products; producers are respon\n-sible for product defects that cause personal and \nproperty damage, and products comply with the \nlegal requirements of all countries. In 2020, 100% \nof BMW Brilliance associates completed this train\n-ing.\nTo enhance our quality management capabilities, \nwe actively engage in dialogue with industry ex\n-perts on latest policies and regulations and best \npractices. In 2020, we held the fifth annual Quality \nManagement Workshop with China Automotive \nTechnology and Research Centre (CATARC), \nwhere experts from government agencies, re\n-search institutions and our company shared in\n-sights on quality management and product safety. \nClose collaboration with industry experts helps us \nmaintain premium product and service quality and \nstrengthen the company™s resilience to policy and \nmarket changes.     \n2020 also marked the launch of the first Product \nIntegrity Seminar, co-hosted by BMW Brilliance \nand VDA QMC, the Quality Management Centre \nof the German Association of the Automotive \nIndustry. The event brought together managers \nand senior leaders from Corporate Quality, R&amp;D, \nProcurement and Supply Chain, Plant Quality, \nCustomer Support, Legal, and more. BMW Bril\n-liance leaders showcased our dedication to prod\n-uct integrity, and jointly discussed how to achieve \nproduct integrity across all operations. At the end \nof the seminar, the Corporate Quality Department \ncommitted to organise an ongoing series of prod\n-uct safety and conformity meetings, seminars, and \naudits to ensure that all requirements are fully and \neffectively implemented.\nBMW Brilliance Quality Governance Structure\nOur Three Lines of Defence\nSUPERVISORY BOARD\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nBOARD OF MANAGEMENT\nFirst Line of Defence\n ŒBusiness Department\n ŒInternal Controls\nSecond Line of Defence\n ŒQuality \nManagement\n ŒCompliance\n ŒControlling\n ŒRisk \nManagement\n ŒSecurity\n ŒOthers\nThird Line of Defence\n ŒCorporate Audit\n\n6059PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY\nAchieving premium product quality requires excep\n-tional product conformity and corporate responsi\n-bility for product safety. BMW Brilliance maintains \nthe high level of quality of products delivered from \nour plants, and we are proud to rank in the highest \nlevels of the BMW Group™s plant network for over\n-all plant delivery quality.\nOUR QUALITY ASPIRATION: ZERO DEFECT\nBMW Brilliance adheres to a Zero Defect goal \nacross our entire process, from order to delivery, \nand the BMW Purchasing and QMT teams drive \nthat process. Suppliers are required to commit to \nthe same level of product quality as the company \nas a whole, and suppliers are selected and eval\n-uated on five strategic criteria: product quality, \nincorporating sustainability into product develop\n-ment, supply chain management, agile and flexible \nproduction, and cost efficiency.\nTo achieve Zero Defect in our production, in all \nnew products, and throughout the supply chain, \nBMW Brilliance utilises Industry 4.0 technologies \nin the pressing, welding, painting, and assembly \nprocesses to enhance our data analytics, further \nimproving process stability and product quality. \nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G tech\n-nologies enhance process and product quality. An \ninnovative AI detection system in use in our plants \nis able to identify and locate casting or machining \ndefects in cylinder heads with 99.7% accuracy. By \nleveraging this system, the BMW Brilliance man\n-ufacturing department has decreased the rework \ntime for this line by 65%, and has demonstrated \nhow this technology can be reused in any industrial \nscenario where tiny object detection is necessary. \nIn 2020, we piloted the use of 5G technologies \nin some processes. For a Welding Point Quality \nCheck pilot, 5G wireless data transmissions al\n-lowed for an increase in quality check measure\n-ment results, with a 3-D camera in use to collect \ndata. \nProduction simulation is another promising tech\n-nology in use in BMW Brilliance plants. Simulating \nand closely monitoring every step of a process al\n-lows for the identification of every minor deviation, \nand enables us to correct the error virtually before \nentering physical production.\nReliability is a key element of product quality, and \nour quality management system also covers prod\n-uct use. BMW Brilliance monitors our products and \ninvestigates any reports relating to safety. Upon \nuncovering any safety or quality issues, we imme\n-diately inform the relevant authorities and take all \nnecessary steps to protect our customers.\nPRODUCT SAFETY DESIGN\nOffering our customers the safest products on the \nroad begins at the design phaseŠand benefits all \nroad users.

The premium customer experience we seek \nto create delivers a unique, personalised ecosystem that in\n-tegrates digitalisation inside as well as outside the vehicle. \nCREATING PREMIUM CUSTOMER JOURNEY\nWe have developed a seamless, unified customer journey \nthat connects individuals with the BMW brand across all \ncustomer-facing platforms and spanning vertical and par\n-allel business units. Empowered by a digital transformation \nthat breaks through the barriers of data integration, cus\n-tomers are able to connect at every touchpoint, whether \nonline or offline, with the company and BMW products. In \n2020, we launched a strategic collaborative partnership \nwith Alibaba, where we developed a closed-loop E2E, O2O \ne-commerce solution to improve user experience. Among \nthe other customer-facing digital touchpoints launched in \n2020 include the brand-new My BMW app, BMW E-Mall, a \nlive broadcast feature, and a virtual showroom that brings \nthe BMW experience directly to customers.\nHIGHEST SERVICE STANDARD AT DEALERSHIPS\nBMW\'s dealer network plays an important role in connect\n-ing the customer experience from online to offline, and en\n-suring that the premium service quality they offer lives up to \nthe BMW standard. We ensure that every dealer meets the \n10 Promises for premium customer service, including con\n-venient parking, a warm welcome into a clean and elegant \nenvironment, professional consultations, and much more. \nThese 10 Promises are involved in various business stand\n-ards of dealers\' operations that every BMW dealer must \nmeet, such as SPC, APA, and Retail Standards. These \nstandards detail the expectations that shape customers™ ex\n-perience when visiting a dealership, and dealers complete a \nrigorous audit that evaluates every aspect of a dealership™s \noperations, including sales process quality, aftersales pro\n-cess quality, and the overall state of the customer-facing \nareas of the dealership as well as the repair facilities. Ensur\n-ing our dealers live up to these standards helps provide the \npremium experience that BMW customers expect. \nPEACEFUL INSIDE\nTo minimise interior noise for the new BMW \niX3, we collaborated with tyre suppliers to \ndevelop specialised standard (non-run-flat) \ntyres, reducing road noise while maxim\n-ising tyre safety. The back of the vehicle is \nequipped with soundproofing designs such \nas sound dampening mat to reduce noise \nfrom the E-motor, creating a peaceful driv\n-ing experience. \nPROMOTING DRIVING SAFETY \nWe design and manufacture BMW vehicles for maximum safety, but even the \nbest-designed vehicles operate only as safely as the driver™s skills allow. The \nBMW Driving Experience China programme has been developed to offer safe\n-ty-focussed training courses that allow participants to respond to a wide range \nof road emergencies. After learning driving-safety tips and tricks to correctly as\n-sess and identify critical situations, participants get to experience a number of \nreal-world situations, guided by an elite team of BMW driving trainers, to learn to \nhandle their BMW vehicle with confidence and pleasure. In 2020, 17,020 partici\n-pants took part in our Driving Experience training courses and events.\nENSURING CUSTOMER HEALTH\nBMW Brilliance is committed to providing \na healthy and comfortable interior for pas\n-sengers by reducing Volatile Organic Com\n-pound (VOC) emissions, improving interior \nair quality, and minimising interior noise. \nFrom the beginning design stages of our \nproducts, our VOC management flow sets \nmultiple inspection points to adhere to the \nBMW Group specifications on VOC emis\n-sions from interior components, including \nseats, carpets, and instrument panels. \nAll BMW Brilliance vehicles comply with \ninterior air quality requirements of GB/T \n27630, and we continue to work to exceed \nthose regulations as well as customer ex\n-pectations. In 2020, we collaborated with \nseat suppliers to reduce VOCs in the foam\n-ing materials through optimising material \nformulations, and \nconducted on-site odour \ntesting at our component suppliers™ facili\n-ties.\n By working with suppliers to improve \nsurface materials and reduce odour in seats \nand door panels of the BMW 3 Series, our \nVOC test scores improved noticeably.\n"OEMs should focus \non issues that could \nhave a direct impact \non consumers, such as \ninterior materials safety."\n Š BMW customer\nBMW Brilliance strives to bring a premium experience to our customers.\n\n64\n2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\63/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nAnother way that BMW Brilliance empowers dealers is \nthrough facilitating the adoption of digital and smart solu\n-tions, including continuing to develop the Dealer Mobile \nOffice experience. By digitalising paper-based customer \ninteractions in sales and aftersales service, customers ex\n-perience a smoother, more pleasant dealer visit.\nIn 2020, we continued the Network Transformation Project \nthat launched in 2019, a comprehensive effort to revitalise \nevery BMW Brilliance dealer, inside and out, with new de\n-signs, product presentation, interactive experiences, and \nmore. As of 2020, the Network Transformation Project has \nreached 119 dealers across China. \nVIRTUAL EXPERIENCE AND COMMUNITY\nOur digitalisation efforts extend to BMW Brilliance custom\n-ers and fans as well: A key aspect of the customer-centric \napproach to our operations includes leveraging digital tech\n-nology and innovation to create value for customers while \nstrengthening the social brand experience and personalis\n-ing communications with customers. In 2020, we launched \nan all-new My BMW app, offering a centralised digital space \nto provide value-added services and community for current \nand potential BMW customers as well as fans. The app \nincludes an intelligent connection to BMW cars, updates \non the latest product and company information, and social \nnetworking with the BMW Brilliance community. In addi\n-tion, the China-only version of the app includes a number of \nChina Fit features, such as Community, Membership, and \ne-Commerce, that connect the online and offline experience \nand strengthen customers™ brand connection.\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION &amp; SERVICE EVALUATION\nIn order to gauge the impact of all of our efforts to improve \nand optimise the customer experience, and to ensure that \ncustomer satisfaction remains best in class, we have de\n-veloped multiple channels to help dealerships engage and \nmeasure customer satisfaction. Dealers can use a BMW \nBrilliance communication platform to directly engage with \nother dealers to share best practices with each other and \noffer feedback to our company. Through regular meetings \nwith dealer partners, we are able to connect internal depart\n-ments and establish protocols to address cross-functional \nissues and improve dealer performance.\nOne way we measure customer satisfaction is through the \nJoy Index, which monitors dealer performance in sales and \naftersales services to track improvements over time and \nalign services with customers™ needs and expectations. \nDealer performance increased significantly in 2020: The \npercentage of negative customer feedback fell from 10.9% \nin 2018 to 8.0% in 2020.  \nIn 2020, more dealers adopted the Customer Board Plat\n-form, our second customer-satisfaction tool. The platform \nprovides regular dealer performance reports around service \n2021 OUTLOOK\nIn the coming year, BMW Brilliance intends to continue to \nadvance our industry-leading quality programmes for prod\n-uct quality as well as service quality. We sustain our efforts \nto strengthen our total quality management protocols to en\n-sure that every BMW vehicle meets our own high standards \nand our customers™ high expectations. We will continue to \nconvene a series of product safety and conformity seminars, \nso that the best minds at BMW can continue to share ex\n-pertise and experience around product quality.

The dealerships created a \nseries of engagement activities related to automotive service, \nincluding a mock car-painting service and lessons on how to \ngauge proper tyre pressure. The Ningbo dealerships also de\n-veloped a number of customer-focused activities to engage \ncustomers while their vehicles are being serviced, including a \nreading club, fresh baked goods and coffee, family-friendly \nactivities, and much more. We applaud the customer-centred \napproach and innovative spirit of our award winners.\nEven as we extend our product-quality work, BMW Bril\n-liance will keep the customer at the centre of everything we \ndo. In 2021, we will extend our new customer-facing digital \ntouchpoints to reach more BMW customers and fans, bring \nour Network Transformation Project to even more members \nof our BMW Brilliance dealer network, and invite more deal\n-ers to join our Customer Board Platform. \nBy continuing our dual focus on product and service quality, \nBMW Brilliance will be well-positioned to thrive in 2021 and \nbeyond.\n\n66653 / ACCOUNTABLE, CIRCULAR AND RESILIENT VALUE CHAIN\n65/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\nCIRCULARITY\n3.2\n"Secondary first. \nResources are scarce and \nvaluable. Circularity is both an \naspiration and a promise for us."\n  Š Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the \nBoard of Management of BMW AG\nRAW MATERIALS\nBATTERY RECYCLING\nFar exceeding national regulations, BMW Brilliance has \nadopted a circular economy approach to raw materials. \nWe have made dedicated efforts to increase the amount of \nrecycled materials in our products by working closely with \nsuppliers and recycling partners.\nThe use of steel and aluminium are responsible for a large \nshare of our CO\n˜ emissions, and therefore offers a signifi\n-cant opportunity to reduce our footprint. By returning scrap \naluminium and steel to manufacturers for use as secondary \nraw materials, not only are we reducing our impacts, but we \nare also able to extend our sustainability efforts to more el\n-ements of our supply chain. \nCLOSING THE LOOP\nIn 2020, we created our first closed-loop system in 17 \nyears by working with our steel-manufacturing partners to \nincorporate scrap steel back into their manufacturing pro\n-cesses, and achieved an accumulative recycling volume of \n45,000 t in the loop. By providing clear guidance and strat\n-egy to these suppliers, we were able to help them increase \nthe amount of secondary steel used in the smelting process \nby 3% while still meeting our technical and performance \nrequirements. We have also begun to return our scrap alu\n-minium to one potential supplier for recycling and reusing, \nand will continue to explore the possibility of incorporating \nrepurposed aluminium in our raw materials production for \ncoils and ingot.\nFor BMW NEVs, we are working with our Tier-1 and Tier-2 \nsuppliers for HVBs to use 100% recycled aluminium, at least \n50% secondary material for cobalt and nickel, and 100% \nregenerative energy for BMW™s Gen5 HVB production.\nClosed the loop for steel\nWe established the 1st closed-\nloop system for steel with our \nsupplier in 2020, with 45,000 t \nrecycled in the loop.\nUse of secondary steel\nFirst HVB recycling \nservice outlet \nin Shanghai\nPieces of HVBs recycled\nin the smelting process by our \nsupplier while meeting BMW \ntechnical requirements.\nwas set up to collect, sort, \nstore, and package defective \nand end-of-life HVBs.\na 33.3% increase \nover 2019, with a total \nweight of 98,261 kg.\nIn 2020, we made significant progress on advancing \nthe HVB recycling ecosystem. Our partners in the \nBMW Brilliance dealer network and our R&amp;D centre \nhelp us continue to recycle and repurpose end-of-life \nand defective HVBs.\nADVANCING HVB RECYCLING PATHWAY\nThe HVB recycling process now includes two collec\n-tion models. In some instances, dealerships collect \ndefective batteries and our logistics supplier delivers \nthem to a licensed facility for dismantling; additional\n-ly, in order to fulfil the government requirement and \nexplore new business models, we set up the coun\n-try™s first professional HVB recycling service outlet in \nShanghai, which integrate collection, sorting, storage, \npacking, and relevant services before the HVBs are \ndelivered to a licensed facility for dismantling.\nIn 2020, BMW Brilliance recycled 4,347 HVBsŠa \n33.3% increase over 2019Šweighing 98,261 kg, and \nachieved a 98.5% recycling rate for nickel, cobalt, and \nmanganese. \nPILOTING SECONDARY UTILISATION OF HVB\nsThis year, we launched a pilot project to repurpose \nend-of-life HVBs. After disassembling and processing \nbatteries that can no longer power a BMW automobile, \nwe have developed a method to use those batteries \nto power pallet trucks in our plant workshops, thereby \nextending the life of the battery before dismantling \nand recycling and using clean energy to power these \npallet trucks.\nIn order to achieve a truly sustainable busi\n-ness, we must strive to eliminate waste \nacross our operations. One important way \nthat BMW Brilliance is achieving this goal \nis by developing innovative approaches to \nrepurposing end-of-life materials in new \nways within our products.

We aim to expand \nour parts remanufacturing efforts by \nlaunching new categories of parts, \nstarting production of remanufactured \ntransfer gears and extending our trans\n-mission, mechatronics, and air condi\n-Continuing to maximise the utilisation of the bins has been \na core focus of our circularity work. In 2020, we launched a \ncollaboration with packaging suppliers to explore the possi\n-bility of recycling and remanufacturing bins in order to drive \nmaterial circularity further up the supply chain.\nFor steel bins, our new pilot programme with three bin sup\n-pliers aims to evaluate the feasibility of recycling those bins \nfor remanufacturing, and we will roll out the programme fur\n-ther in 2021. For non-steel bins, made of expanded polypro\n-pylene (EPP), we have begun to investigate with our Tier-1 \nand Tier-2 suppliers the possibility of recycling and reusing \nthese bins.\nIn addition to recycling and reusing packaging materials, \nwe strive to reduce the use of new packaging in the first \nplace by maximising the usability of bins across products \nand extending their lifespan. In 2020, our engineers worked \nalongside bin suppliers to standardise and modularise bin \ndesigns; as a result of this project, we released the BMW \nBrilliance Bin Concept Construction Guidelines in May to \ndetail our requirements for bin design going forward. We \nalso continue to evaluate similarities between product parts \nand are working with suppliers to design existing bins so \nthey can be used across generations of products.\nOur rate of returnable packaging usage for local parts transpor\n-tation remained steady at 98% in 2020, and we continued our \nefforts to promote returnable packaging use for imported parts \nas well. The BMW Brilliance bin-sharing and bin-rental pro\n-gramme, which we rolled out in 2019, expanded in scope this \nyear as we engaged more bin suppliers and service providers.\nBy expanding the scope of our parts-recycling practices, \ndigitalising our reverse logistics systems, and increasing \nour parts-remanufacturing capacity, BMW Brilliance has \nachieved significant progress in circularity.\nIn 2020, we expanded our remanufactured parts portfolio \nwith the launch of three more parts categoriesŠElectrical \nPower Steering (EPS) gear, head units, and mechatronicsŠ\nand we released more material numbers in the Transmission \nproduct portfolio to serve more BMW car models and kicked-\noff the development of remanufactured transfer case. Mean\n-while, we are improving our capability of core collection to \nfacilitate with the enriching of remanufacturing product line. \nIn 2020, we enlarged our core collecting scope to cover cus\n-tomer pay parts besides regular warranty parts return.\nOver the course of the year, we collected 108,070 pieces of \nparts weighing over 669 t. Of these, more than 300 trans\n-missions, 600 steering gears, 2,000 air conditioning com\n-pressors, 100 head units, and 100 mechatronics were put \ninto remanufacturing process in just four months. \nThe ReLife Point (RLP), our centralised facility for parts \nrecycling and removal in Cangzhou, is reaching full func\n-tionality in 2020, and we have been improving the overall \ntraceability of parts reverse logistics from dealerships back \nto the RLP via our transportation hub and spare parts dis\n-tribution centres. In May, we launched Encory China Dealer \nFront-end (ECDF), the parts tracking system to improve the \ntransparency of the overall reverse logistics process, pro\n-viding parts information, logistics status, and more. \nIn 2020, we in total recycled 203.3 t of metal (80% steel and \niron, 20% aluminium), 56.7 t of plastic, and 35.9 t of paper.\ntioning compressor capabilities to re\n-manufacture even more parts. We seek \nto expand our warranty core collection \nscope from 46.5% to 81% to centralise \nrecycling, and enlarge the RLP space \nfrom 5,000 m\n2 to 6,000 m\n2, ensuring \nmore room for centralised scrapping \nand recycling. We will also initiate the \nmarket communication around the con\n-cept of remanufacturing and removal. \nFor our circular packaging efforts, we \nwill explore the potential to further ex\n-pand the scope of our bin-sharing and \nrental bin programmes.\nPARTS REMANUFACTURING\nGREEN PACKAGING\nPieces of parts\nRate of returnable \npackaging usage\nCollected for recycling in 2020, \nwith a total weight of over 669 t. \n3 new parts categories launched \nin 2020 for remanufacturing.\n108,070\n ˝EPS\n ˝HEAD UNITS\n ˝MECHATRONICS\nBMW Brilliance Bin Concept \nConstruction Guideline\nReleased in May 2020 to guide bin design \nto enable cross-generation usage. \nˇfor local parts \ntransportation.\n98%Steel coils storage at steel supplier\'s production facility.\n\n70\n69RESPONSIBLE \nENVIRONMENT, HEALTH \n&amp; SAFETY MANAGEMENT\n3.3\nA truly sustainable company is one \nthat takes responsibility for its impacts \nand works to minimise negative \nimpactsŠon the environment, on our \nworkforce and customers, and on the \ncommunities where we live and work. \nIn addition to adopting the most advanced and \nsustainable production practices, ensuring a safe \nworkplace for employees is our fundamental cor\n-porate responsibility. By managing occupational \nhealth and safety risks in our own operations, we \ncan protect our employees, our most valuable \nresource, from work-related injury and illness. At \nBMW Brilliance, we also take responsibility for \nhelping our dealers and suppliers minimise risk and \nmaximise safety in their operations. The Environ\n-ment, Health and Safety Protection Activity (EPA) \nprogramme has set an industry benchmark as a \nholistic supplier risk-management practice, and we \nwork to empower our dealers to manage the EHS \nrisks associated with their daily operations. \nRESPONSIBLE EHS OPERATIONS AT BMW BRILLIANCE\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT\nAs a responsible company, we strive to minimise \nour environmental footprint during production. All \nof our production plants are certified to the ISO \n14001:2015 Environmental Management System \nstandard. With the increased requirements on en\n-vironmental protection from our diverse stakehold\n-ers, in 2020 we updated the BMW Brilliance En\n-strategy in advance to fulfil the latest stakeholder re\n-quirements and expectations. \nSite compliance management is also our highest pri\n-ority. Our management team has developed targeted \nprogrammes for on-site inspection. ﬁEarly detection, \nearly resolution, and frequent sharingﬂ is our principle \nfor on-site work.\nDIGITISING ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING\nWe aim to keep all employees well-informed on the \nenvironmental impacts most relevant to their duties \nthrough regular trainings. In 2020, we developed \nthree new e-learning courses to advance their ed\n-ucation: Two courses were designed for the core \nenvironmental team, on identifying environmental as\n-pects and impacts of projects and an environmental \nemergency exercise; one course, on training for waste \nclassification, was open to all associates. In 2020, \n560 associates joined the e-learning courses; for \nwaste classification, we also conducted face-to-face \ntrainings led by section leaders and environmental \nmanagement team. \nIn addition to formal learning programmes, our en\n-vironmental management team conducts initiatives \nand campaigns designed to foster awareness and \ndrive behavioural change among employees through \non-site interaction, pop-up in intranet, and mobile \npush notifications through the JoyChat app. Among \nthe campaigns we promoted in 2020 included notifi\n-cations about new standards for waste classification \nand around the importance of biodiversity.\nBody painting process at our Paint Shop. \nEnvironmental governance and steering at BMW Brilliance\nGreen Plant Circle\nComprises plant directors and the head of each technology, \nresponsible for decision-making on environmental issues \nand production activities.\nEnvironmental Steering Committee\nCross-functional environmental target steering \nand monitoring, project planning and performance \nevaluation.\nPlant Level\nProject implementation at various departments and \nworkshops. Ideation of new concepts and measures.\n˙˙˙˙BMW Brilliance has established a variety of channels \nto foster an environmental mindset. The Environ\n-mental Steering Committee (ESC) offers a well-es\n-tablished structure with clear designation of respon\n-sibilities for steering and execution, which engages \nemployees from management circle to the front-line \nplant level. The ESC effectively steers our environ\n-mental target-setting and monitoring, project planning \nand implementation, and performance evaluation.\nIn addition, plant directors and the head of each \ntechnology led the green plant circle, which played \nan active role in environmental protection. We are \nexploring additional enablers and opportunities, such \nas energy-saving measures and zero waste practices, \nwhich will generate a number of additional ideas for \nenvironmental protection.\nTo responsibly manage the risks and uncover the \nopportunities inherent in our business, the BMW \nBrilliance approach covers the whole life cycle of the \nprojects. The environmental management team is \ninvolved during the project design phase to analyse \nthe environmental aspects and impacts to avoid \nforeseeable risks and embed environmentally friend\n-ly concepts as early as possible. During the con\n-struction phase, we monitor the potential risks and \nensure compliance together with the project team. \nFor small-scale project modifications, the project \nteam collaborates with the environmental manage\n-ment team to prioritise environment-friendly thinking \nearly in by completing a risk identification and eval\n-uation checklist, which highlights 12 critical topics, \nincluding wastewater discharge, air emissions, noise \ngeneration, groundwater usage, and environmental \ncompliance risks.\nKEEP ABREAST OF REGULATORY CHANGE\nThe environmental management team also works in \nclose collaboration with the compliance team to stay \nup-to-date on regulatory changes; for instance, in \n2020 the two teams worked together to deliver up\n-dates on environment-related laws and policies and \nassociated risks. A total of 55 items were identified \nas a result of envirionmental laws and regulation up\n-dates, and the evaluation result was released by using \nthe company channel of Legislation Express. Espe\n-cially for the key areas of environmental protection \nin the 13th Five-Year PlanŠVOCs and waste man\n-agement, where there are significant amendments \nto legislation and regulations in 2020, we map out a \nvironmental Management Manual with a detailed \ndescription of the company™s environmental man\n-agement updates. For example, we completed the \nenvironmental risks and opportunities evaluation \nprocess within our environmental aspect evalua\n-tion and compliance-monitoring procedures; we \nenlarged the scope of the change management \nprocess for normal and significant projects.\n\n71722020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\REDUCING VOC EMISSIONS\nA key part of our green production \nefforts includes goals to reduce VOC \nemissions in our products and in our \nfacilities. In 2020, we launched an on\n-line VOC monitoring system in Paint \nShop to enable our teams to monitor \nVOC emissions in real-time and iden\n-tify hotspots. We continue to expand \nthe use of water-based solvents, and \nin recognition of our industry exper\n-tise, the BMW Brilliance team was \ninvited to engage in the evaluation \nprocess for the Liaoning provincial \nVOC emission standard for industrial \ncoating processes, which went into \neffect at the end of 2019.\nIn recognition of our industry expertise, \nthe BMW Brilliance team was invited to \nengage in the evaluation process for the \nlatest Liaoning provincial VOC emission \nstandard for industrial coating process\n-es. Because of our early involvement \nin the implementation of this environ\n-mental standard, BMW Brilliance was \nwell-positioned to meet the require\n-ments of the rule. As of the end of 2020, \nwe have updated our existing VOC \nabatement facilities in Plant Tiexi. For \nthe Tiexi New Plant and Plant Dadong \nExtension projects, we will install and \nuse the state-of-the-art VOC treatment \nfacilities, which we expect to significant\n-ly reduce our VOC emissions. In 2020, \nwe reduced our per-vehicle VOC emis\n-sions by 3.8% from 2019 to 0.50 kg per \nvehicle produced.\nMINIMISING WASTE\nBy improving our waste-flow tracking \nand enhancing the traceability of our \nhazardous waste, we are better able \nto continue to reduce and responsi\n-bly manage the waste generated by \nour operations. The BMW Brilliance \nwaste treatment information system \nkeeps detailed records of the waste we \nproduce, and we meet or exceed the \nrequirements of all waste-management \nregulations. For instance, the new Law \nof the People™s Republic of China on the \nPrevention and Control of Solid Waste \nPollution requires producers to be able \nto trace hazardous waste back to a spe\n-cific plant and a responsible individual.\nIn 2020, we advanced several initia\n-tives to reduce our waste volume and \nincrease the amount of waste we can \nrecycle and repurpose. We fully rolled \nout our sludge dehydration programme \nat Plant Tiexi in 2020, which decreases \nthe water content of sludge by 40%, re\n-ducing sludge generation by about 1 kg \nper car produced. We will roll out a simi\n-lar programme at Plant Dadong in 2021. \nAll of our domestic waste is delivered \nto domestic waste treatment plants for \nincineration to generate power. Also \nin 2020, we expanded our partnership \nwith a cement factory to recycle waste \nsand for use in raw materials to produce \ncement, recycling 12,785 t of waste \nsand, and we are in discussions with \nour partner to deliver additional waste \nas our operations expand in the coming \nyears.\nAll potential BMW Brilliance waste han\n-dling suppliers undergo an extensive \nevaluation process, including a detailed \nreview of the supplier™s qualifications for \nwaste treatment and on-site assess\n-ments of their management status and \ncapabilities to find the most environ\n-mentally friendly, low-impact treatment \nmethods. For existing suppliers, we \naudit their documentation and continu\n-ously perform on-site audits, ensuring \nthe valid disposal of the waste. In 2020, \nas a result of adjustments in waste \nclassification and improvement of the \ntreatment processes, the waste-per-ve\n-hicle we sent for disposal fell to 2.99 kg \nper vehicle produced, a nearly 60.0% \nreduction from 2019.\nWATER AND WASTEWATER \nMANAGEMENT\nWe are striving to reduce our water \nconsumption and continue to improve \nour wastewater management. We \nuse reclaimed treated wastewater \nfrom our on-site treatment plant for \nlandscaping and cooling purposes, as \nwell as dust control for the Tiexi New \nPlant project. In 2020, the waste\n-water recycling systems at Plant \nTiexi and Plant Powertrain recycled \n154,090 m\n3 of water. Plant Dadong in \n2020 reclaimed 39,832 m\n3 of water; \nwe are currently expanding the facili\n-ty™s water reclamation capacity which \nwe expect will increase our capacity \nby 800 m\n3 per day. Our wastewater \nquality monitoring process combines \nreal-time monitoring with regular \nlab testing to ensure our wastewater \nmeets regional and national quality \nstandards. \nIn addition to water reclamation and \nrecycling, all BMW Brilliance facilities \nconsistently take routine water-effi\n-ciency measures, including the use \nof water-efficient fixtures and post\n-ing water-saving reminder signage \nthroughout production and office \nspaces.

Our Occupational Health &amp; Safety \n(OHS) Management System has been \ncomprehensively developed in accord\n-ance with the BMW Group Health &amp; \nSafety policy, U.N. Global Compact prin\n-ciples, the ISO 45001:2018 standard, \nthe International Labour Organisation™s \nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles \nand Rights at Work, and all applicable \noccupational health and safety laws \nand regulations in China. \nThe company™s senior leadership takes \noverall responsibility and accountabil\n-ity for preventing work-related injuries \nand ensuring safe and healthy work\n-places for all employees. Our leader\n-ship team has developed OHS policies \nand objects to align with our strategic \ngoals and ensures the effective opera\n-tion and continual improvement of the \nsystem. The CEO appoints the Head \nof Security, Occupational Safety and \nServices Dpartment, as the Occupa\n-tional Health and Safety Management \nsafety risks, including physical, chemi\n-cal, and ergonomic hazards associated \nwith different job functions, and other \npotential risks in the production pro\n-cess. To address these risks and max\n-imise employees™ long-term health and \nperformance, we have implemented ef\n-fective countermeasures, and series of \nactivities and programmes on the basis \nof our OHS Management System.\nWe use Safety and Ergonomics Risk \nAssessment (SERA) to assess the \nphysical, mental, work environment, \nand workplace-specific risks, and \nstresses throughout our operations \nwhere we make optimisation accord\n-ingly. We also conduct industrial hy\n-giene monitoring at each of our plants \nevery year, evaluating and document\n-ing employees™ potential exposures to \noccupational health hazards. Based \non the monitoring results, we take ef\n-fective countermeasures to protect our \nworkers. In addition, as the increasing \naverage age of our workforce brings \nnew health challenges, we implement \nthe Today for Tomorrow &gt; NEXT pro\n-gramme focussing on musculoskele\n-tal disorders to help employees stay \nhealthy and perform well with increas\n-ing age.\nTo enhance workplace safety, we \nconduct regular safety inspections \nto identify and rectify employee\'s \nunsafe behaviours, equipment and \nfacilities\' unsafe condition, as well as \nother potential safety risk. For the \nspecial equipment used in our plants, \nwe conduct annual inspections and \nengage licensed suppliers for periodic \nequipment maintenance to ensure \ncompliance with national regulations. \nEach year we also carry out on-site \nemergency drills, to test and review the \nefficiency of the emergency response \nprocess, and to familiarise employees \nwith relevant procedures and require\n-ments. \nOHS TRAINING AND \nCOMMUNICATION\nTo ensure that every BMW Brilliance \nemployee knows that safety is their re\n-sponsibility, enhance safety awareness \nand knoeldge, and promote a positive \nsafety culture, we conduct a number of \ntrainings and educational programmes \nto build a comprehensive understand\n-ing of safety knowledge among our \nemployees. Each year, in accordance \nwith legal requirements, our compa\n-ny™s senior leadership and safety man\n-agement staffs complete the Safety \n&amp; Health Responsible Management \ntraining delivered by a government-au\n-thorised training organisation. \nWe deliver Three-Level Safety Educa\n-tion to all new associates, job transfer \nassociates, and return-to-work as\n-sociates, and Four-New Education \nprogramme to related associates to \nthat keep them informed of the safety \npractices about new processes, new \ntechnologies, new materials, and new \nequipment. Associates working in spe\n-cialised positions also receive topical \nsafety training on personal protective \nequipment, Lockout/Tagout, chemical \nsafety, confined space safety, and more.\nIn addition to the regular trainings our \nassociates complete, we have devel\n-oped a number of channels for OHS in\n-formation communications and employ\n-ee consultations. During Safety Month, \nwe gave recognition to associates \ninvolved in exceptional safety activities. \nThroughout the year, we involve asso\n-ciates in conducting safety inspections \nand safety improvements through our \nValue-added Production System (VPS). \nIMMERSIVE SAFETY TRAINING \nAT TIEXI NEW PLANT\nThe newly established safety training \ncentre at the Tiexi New Plant project site \noffers workers an immersive learning \nexperience. Through simulation-based \nsafety training modules, workers are \nable to develop better understanding \nof job-specific safety practices. Upon \ncompleting all training programmes, \nworkers need to pass a safety test \nbefore gaining access to the construc\n-tion site. The project team also arranges \nsafety drills to help workers respond to \nemergencies such as falling accidents in \na timely and effective manner.\n˜47.1\n%ISO 45001:2018\nOHS Management System\nWORK SAFETY \nSTANDARDISATION\nLevel 2 Certification\nOHS management \naccreditation earned \nby BMW Brilliance:\nAccident frequency rate\nper one million hours worked*\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n2020\n0.09\n2019\n0.17\n2018\n0.28\n2017\n0.43\n2016\n0.54\n* The scope only covers directly contracted employees in the production plants.

The EPA programme is intended \nto strengthen a partnership with our suppliers to \nhelp enhance joint EHS management and effec\n-tively improve all parties™ \nenvironmental and risk \nawareness.\nOur approach provides \nlow-risk suppliers with a \nself-assessment checklist \nplus a ﬁChallenge Round,ﬂ \nduring which we ask \nthem to provide additional evidence supporting \ntheir self-assessment results. High-risk suppliers \nengage with an independent third party for an on-\nsite assessment of potentially high-risk production \nactivities and technologies. For all suppliers, we \noffer support to help them implement any correc\n-tive actions needed and continuously build their \nsafety capacity. In addition, the digital Environ\n-mental Risk Management System (ERMS) enables \nus and our suppliers to respond earlier and better \nto potential EHS risks related to weather events, \nsafety incidents, policy changes, and more. \nJust as BMW Brilliance seeks to be a leader in occupational health and safety in our own operations, we \nare equally committed to building a first-class supplier network in China that adheres to our high stand\n-ards of responsibility and accountability in managing EHS risks in their own operations and supply chains.\nADVANCING EHS PERFORMANCE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN\nSUPPLIER RISK ASSESSMENT \nAND PERFORMANCE\nBy the end of 2020, the EPA has completed 269 \non-site supplier assessments and 846 supplier \nself-assessments. We have identified more than 50 \nhigh-risk production activities or technologies across \ndifferent tiers of suppliers in different sectors, all \nspecific to the auto industry in China. As a result of \nthis work, we have established a solid supplier EHS \nrisk database that forms the basis of integrating EHS \ntopics in our overall supplier management activityŠ\na first for the BMW Group globally.\nIn 2020, our third-party auditors conducted 87 \nonsite EHS audits of key suppliers. We also initi\n-ated 170 suppliers to conduct ﬁChallenge Roundﬂ \nEHS self-assessments. Following the initial round \nof assessments, corrective and preventative \nactions were implemented and most suppliers \ndemonstrated significant improvements in reduc\n-ing risk levels from high and medium to low. By the \nend of 2020, we exceeded our target of helping \nthe top 10 high-risk suppliers achieve an EHS im\n-provement rate of 20%.\nWe also optimised our ﬁChallenge Roundﬂ approach in \n2020 to better identify potential risks among our sup\n-pliers. Suppliers™ self-assessments receive further re\n-view from a Challenger, who can re-score each item in \nthe self-assessment checklist if any initial results are \nincomplete or suspicious. If a Challenger believes that \nthere are high-risk aspects of a supplier™s operations, \nwe initiate a third-party assessment to verify find\n-ings and chart an action plan. Through this process, \nwe help strengthen our suppliers™ accountability and \nownership of their EHS management practices.\nﬁBMW is the first OEM that \nhas realised EHS management \nthroughout the supply chain \nfrom Tier-1 to N-Tier.ﬂ \n Š A BMW supplier\nFrom the inception of our EPA programme to the end of \n2020, we have made the following progress:\n269\nOn-site supplier assessments completed.\n846\nSupplier self-assessments completed.\n50\n+Industry-specific high-risk activities identified\n.10Risk management processes established.\nAdditionally, in 2020 we enhanced our training ap\n-proaches, developing 15 EHS training videos to share \non our JoyChat platform, allowing suppliers to con\n-tinue their safety education at any time. The topics \nincluded relevant laws and regulations on fire safety, \nnoise, waste management and other critical EHS \ntopics. \nIn recognition of our efforts in building sustainable \nsupply chain, BMW Brilliance received the 2020 \n"UNGC China Network Best Enterprise Practices" \naward from the United Nations Global Compact.\nHigh Risk\nMedium Risk\nLow Risk\n2020 On-site supplier EHS assessment \n- 1st round result: \n2020 On-site supplier EHS assessment\n- Final round result: \nCorrective\nactions\n˙2020 "Challenge Round" supplier self-assessment \n- 1st round result: \n2020 "Challenge Round" supplier self-assessment  \n- Final round result: \nCorrective\nactions\n˙\n78Dealers are our partners in every aspect of our business, and we aim to encourage and \nempower all our dealers to build capacity and awareness around managing the EHS \nrisks in their daily operations.\nOur key approaches include setting performance requirements by integrating EHS-re\n-lated compliance requirements such as hazardous waste management into our Retail \nStandards, enabling toolkits such as the EHS Manual and EHS Self-checklist we pro\n-vide to guide dealers as they identify and control risks in compliance with legal require\n-ments, and offering capacity-building workshops, trainings, and the Dealer EHS Help\n-desk to support their day-to-day EHS management.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted our priorities from conducting in-per\n-son EHS workshops to updating the EHS Manual and creating online training materi\n-als. The newest editions of the EHS Manual and Self-checklist include new regulatory \nstandards related to NEV servicing, particularly around storage management for end-\nof-life batteries and safety precautions for NEV maintenance. We published step-by-\nstep training videos on EHS management on our JOY Learning app for dealers to use \nas needed.\nEMPOWERING DEALER PARTNERS \nIN EHS MANAGEMENT\n2021 OUTLOOK\nIn the coming year, the BMW Brilliance \nEHS team will optimise hazardous \nwaste tracking and handling and work \nto increase the variety of environmental \nawareness-fostering programmes and \ntraining events we host. We will also \ncontinue to develop new e-learning \ncourses throughout 2021.\nFor suppliers, we have shifted our \napproach from risk control to risk pre\n-vention, and in 2021 we will continue \nto work with our supply chain partners \nto internalise and develop their own \nrisk-management system. By focus\n-sing on our first-tier suppliers™ efforts \nto work with their own supply chains, \nwe are able to help these companies \nincrease their own safety mindset \nand cascade safety practices farther \nthroughout the industry.\nWe will continue to work with our \ndealers in 2021 to complete the roll-\nout of the EHS self-assessment and \nenabling toolkit to all dealers, and pro\n-vide corresponding online and offline \ncapacity-building activities throughout \nthe year. We will further integrate EHS \nself-assessment into Retail Standards \nas a performance requirement under \nﬁbusiness foundationsﬂ, and we will \ndevelop a mechanism to answer dealer \nquestions on EHS self-assessment and \nregulatory requirements.\nA servicing workshop of a BMW dealership.\n77/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\n3 / ACCOUNTABLE\n, CIRCULAR AND RESILIENT VALUE CHAIN\n\n8079BUSINESS \nACCOUNTABILITY\n3.4\nAs a company committed to operating respon\n-sibly and ethically, BMW Brilliance takes great \ncare to thoughtfully manage every aspect of our \nbusiness. From how we source the raw materials \nfor our products to how we safeguard our cus\n-tomers™ personal information, we are dedicated \nto excellence, and we expect our stakeholders to \nensure we live up to our high standards.\nCobalt and lithium are two of the critical raw materials con\n-tained in the HVBs that help power our NEV fleet. Sourcing \nthese materials can have social impacts in the countries \nwhere they are mined, particularly in the Democratic Re\n-public of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries; BMW \nBrilliance has initiated material-specific sourcing strategies \nto ensure maximum transparency and foster responsible \nbusiness practices across our supply chain.\nIn 2020, we began sourcing cobalt for the Gen5 HVB cells \ndirectly from mines outside of the DRCŠin Australia and \nMoroccoŠand made it available to our HVB manufacturer. \nWith full transparency over the origin of cobalt, we are able \nto minimise the risk of child labour and human rights viola\n-tions from sourcing this material.\nBMW Brilliance has signed long-term contracts with lithi\n-um suppliers to make the raw materials available for bat\n-tery-cell suppliers and their upstream suppliers. As with \ncobalt, we began sourcing lithium directly from raw material \nsuppliers to increase traceability within our lithium supply \nchain. We will continue to ensure that our suppliers control \nand mitigate the environmental impacts associated with \nlithium mining.\nEnsuring that our suppliers adhere to BMW Brilliance™s ex\n-pectations for social responsibility is a core aspect of our sup\n-ply chain management framework. In 2020, we established \nthe BMW Brilliance Supplier Social Responsibility Code of \nConduct, which we have begun promoting and integrating \nacross our entire supply chain. The Code of Conduct outlines \nhow we expect our suppliers to promote social responsibility \nin four areas: people-oriented, ethical business practices, re\n-sponsible sourcing, and management system. Alongside the \ndevelopment of the Code of Conduct, we have also expanded \nthe scope of our supply chain social risk assessments and \nupdated the supplier social audit checklist to integrate Re\n-sponsible Business Alliance (RBA) requirements.\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING OF \nRAW MATERIALS \nSETTING SUPPLIER SOCIAL \nRESPONSIBILITY STANDARDS\nINFORMATION SECURITY &amp; DATA PRIVACY\nJust as we are committed to the highest standards of ethics \nin our own operations, BMW Brilliance expects our dealer \nnetworks to conduct business in the same manner. \nWe have developed a comprehensive approach to ensure \nintegrity in our dealers™ operations.

Contributing to \nlocal communities, stakeholders, \nand society is not a \'nice-to-have\' \noption for BMW Brilliance, but a \n\'must-do\' on our priority list.ﬂ\nDr. Johann Wieland, \nPresident and CEO of BMW \nBrilliance Automotive, \ndelivering a speech on the \n2020 BMW Supplier Media \nVisit event in October 2020. \n\n103\n104\n2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\2020 was a particularly hard time for our com\n-pany and Chinese society as a whole. Since the \noutbreak of COVID-19, BMW China and BMW \nBrilliance have focused on meeting Chinese soci\n-ety™s most pressing needs. The social issues and \nneeds we faced before the pandemic have not \ndisappeared, rather they have become more acute \nin the past year, which drives us to reinforce our \ncommitment to CSR. \nFIRST RESPONDER TO THE CRISIS\nThat commitment led us to be a first responder \nduring the crisis: We quickly adapted our CSR \nstrategy to achieve solid, wide-ranging social im\n-pact. Relying on our mature and systematic CSR \nstrategy, as well as the strong connections we had \nbuilt with all our stakeholders, we donated a total \nof 35 million RMB to support the battle against the \npandemic and helped establish the first national \nmental health and counselling hotline for frontline \nmedical personnel, patients, and volunteers.\nOur company culture of flexibility and innovation \nalso allowed us to advance our flagship CSR pro\n-grammes despite the huge disruptions we faced \nin 2020. We adopted a no-contact engagement \napproach to align with social distancing policy: \nWe developed innovative ways to continue our \nflagship BMW Children™s Traffic Safety Education \nprogramme online, extended the reach of our \nBMW JOY Home support for disadvantaged chil\n-dren, and leveraged livestreaming platforms to sell \nIntangible Cultural Heritage products during the \nBMW China Culture Journey to Liaoning.\nWe witnessed how CSR becomes a mirror, reflect\n-ing a company™s relationship with its communities \nand society at largeŠand how crucial a role CSR \nplays in creating shared value for society amid the \ncomplexities of social governance.\nA GREAT COMPANY MUST BE A \nRESPONSIBLE COMPANY\nFor a company to grow from good to great, we \nbelieve that it must stand for more than just sales \nperformance and profitability. A great company \nshould also be a responsible company that closely \nengages in social issues to promote social devel\n-opment.\nBMW China and BMW Brilliance are driven to use \nour platformŠour brand influence, our industry \nknowledge, and our experience as a responsible \ncorporate citizenŠto create shared value for our \ncommunities and our business. Guided by our core \nvalues, we have developed CSR programmes that \ndeeply engage our stakeholders as partners to \njointly solve real problems in our communities and \nour society with the aim of making long-term con\n-tributions to Chinese society. \nWe believe that China\'s social need is our need, and we are \ncommitted to taking a leading role in responding to social \nchallenges and contributing to Chinese society in this difficult time.\nCORPORATE\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nRETHINKING OUR CSR APPROACH\nThe disruptions that our business faced in 2020 \nallowed BMW China and BMW Brilliance to show\n-case our flexibility, innovation, and resilience in CSR \nstrategy and approach. We quickly developed ways \nto integrate our online and offline CSR activities, so \nthat both types of engagement could reinforce each \nother and generate more profound influence. As the \ncountry came together to respond to the pandemic \nand support medical workers, we embedded our \nCSR ethos even deeper in our business practices, \nemphasising our ability to create shared value that \nbenefits both society and the enterprise.\nAs China enters the post-pandemic era, we rec\n-ognise that CSR is more important than ever, and \nBMW China and BMW Brilliance are committed to \nreflecting and refreshing our understanding of and \napproach to CSRŠour purpose must continue to be \ngreater than making profits. We believe that large \ncompanies like ours, with more resources and pow\n-er at our disposal, have a greater responsibility to \ndo more for society. \nIn the future, we will optimise our internal disaster \nrapid-response mechanisms, create a stakehold\n-er-engaged public welfare platform to make our \ncorporate matching donations more impactful and \ninfluential and follow the impacts of the pandemic \nand remain prepared to assist in China™s recovery.\n4.3\nDelivering the BMW CTSE training programme at a local school. \nBMW WARM HEART FUND STARTS \nA NEW CHAPTER\nAfter the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the BMW \nWarm Heart Fund was established jointly by BMW \nChina and BMW Brilliance, which was the first cor\n-porate fund in China™s auto industry. Since then, the \nBMW Warm Heart Fund has always been among \nthe first to respond to major disasters or epidemics. \nIt has developed into a platform that widely engages \nstakeholders to make contributions to Chinese socie\n-ty together, and since 2008, we have accumulatively \ndonated over 97 million RMB in charitable causes.\nIn 2020, despite the pandemic and its economic fall\n-out, BMW China and BMW Brilliance increased our \nCSR investment: We announced a joint donation of 10 \nmillion RMB and a pledge to donate an additional 10 \nmillion RMB every year to increase our investment in \nthe BMW Warm Heart Fund, and working in partner\n-ship with China Education Development Foundation, \nwe will engage even more people with BMW™s CSR \nprogrammes and continue to contribute to China™s \nsocial development.\nTotal beneficiaries of \nBMW CSR activities in 2020.\n11,568,364\n\n4 / RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP\n105\n/ BMW BRILLIANCE AUTOMOTIVE\n106\n2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n \\Since the outbreak of COVID-19, BMW China \nand BMW Brilliance have targeted our sup\n-port to society™s most pressing needs. BMW \nwas one of the first global brands in the auto \nindustry to commit funds to fight COVID-19 \nin China. Through three waves of donations, \nBMW China and BMW Brilliance created \ncontinuous and recognised social impact in \nChinese society and received unanimous \npraise from BMW associates, dealers, cus\n-tomers, beneficiaries, and the public.\nJANUARY 26\nFIRST DONATION\nSECOND DONATION\nTHIRD DONATION\nASSOCIATE DONATION\nIOOI IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nFEBRUARY 12\nFEBRUARY 14\nFEBRUARY 18 \nMID˚2020\nWe made our first donation \nof 5 million RMB to the Hu\n-bei Charity Foundation, to \npurchase urgently needed \nmedical supplies, and help \ntreat patients in local hos\n-pitals.\nWe announced a further donation of \n25 million RMB to the China Popula\n-tion Welfare Foundation to purchase \nurgently needed medical equipment \nfor hospitals in Wuhan as well as oth\n-er cities in Hubei Province and to es\n-tablish the first national mental health \nand counselling hotline for all frontline \nmedical personnel, patients, and vol\n-unteers. \nThe second donation by BMW China \nand BMW Brilliance fully considers \nand responds to the needs of medical \npersonnel. By funding to establish \nthe first national mental health hot\n-line, we innovated and redirected the \nsocial focus gradually from cash and \nsupplies donation to services support.\nWe sent 5 million RMB to \nthe Sixth People™s Hospi\n-tal of Shenyang in view of \nthe urgent need to support \nmedical personnel in Liaon\n-ing and Shenyang to fight \nthe epidemic. Those funds \nwere directed to purchase \nurgently needed supplies \nand medical equipment in \nour hometown.\nTo help our associates con\n-tribute to the fight against \nCOVID-19, BMW China and \nBMW Brilliance initiated an \nassociate donation on Feb\n-ruary 18 to the Huanggang \nCentral Hospital and the \nXiaogan Central Hospital in \nHubei province to purchase \nurgently needed medical \nsupplies. \nTo gauge the impact of our anti-pandemic donations, BMW \nChina and BMW Brilliance uses a comprehensive, scientif\n-ic social responsibility assessment known as IOOI (Input, \nOutput, Outcome, Impact). According to the evaluation, \nthe overall donation goal was completely achieved and the \nutilisation rate of donation reached 100%.

As an entrepreneur, I hope \nthat every enterprise, regardless of size, can act \nresponsibly and do something for society."\nBMW™s stakeholders have joined in the fight as well: Our dealers, associates and \nwarm-hearted customers led collective donations of cash as well as much-needed \nsupplies and equipment, and also provided volunteer services. Our systematic stake\n-holder-engaged public welfare platform makes all these rapid responses possible. \nThe BMW CSR team published a series of articles themed ﬁYour Action, BMW\'s Epito\n-meﬂ on BMW stakeholders who conducted a variety of charitable activities to fight the \nepidemic. The series of reports generated great social impact, improved cohesion , \nand a sense of honour among BMW car owners, associates and dealers.\n\n110\n109\nBMW CSR \nPROGRAMMES\nBMW CHILDREN™S \nTRAFFIC SAFETY \nEDUCATION \nWe have developed our flagship CSR programmes to address social issues in \nthree areas. And as China enters the post-pandemic era, BMW is more commit\n-ted than ever to contribute to Chinese society. Although all businesses are facing \nunprecedented challenges as a result of COVID-19, BMW has been one of the first \nin China™s automotive industry to restart CSR programmes. We will continue our \ninnovative CSR solutions and programmes as part of our long-term commitment \nto benefitting Chinese society. \nSince 2005, the BMW Children\'s Traffic \nSafety Education (CTSE) programme \nhas been promoting public awareness \nof traffic safety, raising awareness of \nchildren and families about safe behav\n-iour and activities around roads and \nvehicles. CTSE is the longest-standing \nCSR programme of BMW in China and \nits development in the past 16 years \nexemplifies BMW™s long-term commit\n-ment to the Chinese society. \nFROM OFFLINE TO ONLINE\nIn 2020, influenced by the COVID-19 \npandemic, the new trend of online \nlearning and no-contact media com\n-munication posed new challenges to \ntraditional event pattern of BMW CTSE. \nThus, BMW CTSE shifted its focus from \noffline events to online communication \nand an online platform, which enables \nteachers, parents, volunteers and po\n-liceman to easily deliver road safety \neducation courses to children.\nOn Children™s Day, we launched our \nCTSE Online Platform in partner\n-ship with the China Children\'s Press \n&amp; Publication Group and the Traffic \nSafety Research Centre of the Ministry \nof Public Security, under the guidance \nof the Traffic Management Bureau \nof the Ministry of Public Security. By \ninnovating our CTSE activities online, \nwe have been able to sustain our \ncommitment to providing life-saving \nsafety education and reach even more \npeople. The Online Platform offers \ngames, augmented reality exhibitions, \ntraining classes, and live-streaming \nBMW CTSE class held at a BMW dealership.\nContinue to boost drivers™ \nawareness of traffic safety to \noneself, to others, and to the \nsociety to improve Chinese \nchildren\'s traffic safety \nawareness and skills.\nBMW CHILDREN\'S TRAFFIC \nSAFETY EDUCATION\n1.BMW CHINA \nCULTURE JOUNREY\nConserve Chinese \ntraditional culture \nand develop Chinese \nintangible cultural \nheritage.\n2.\nBMW \nJOY HOME\nFocus on and subsidise \nspecific disadvantaged \ngroups in the society, such \nas migrant children and left-\nbehind children in China\'s \nunderdeveloped areas.\n3.events; by the end of 2020, it received more than 2.68 mil\n-lion views and excellent feedback from teachers, parents, \nand BMW dealerships.\nThe establishment of the CTSE platform mobilised social \npower to promote traffic safety education, engaging traffic \npolice, teachers, volunteers, parents, and children to partici\n-pate in traffic safety education. At the same time, during the \npandemic, the platform continued to meet the needs of society \nfor traffic safety education with the help of the Internet\'s wide \ncoverage, strong interaction, strong influence, and rich forms.\nTo better engage stakeholders under the new normal of \nno-contact communication, we released an interactive H5 \ne-poster, to invite the media to take selfies and share their \nposters on WeChat Moment, endorsing BMW™s advocacy \non ﬁOne Helmet, One Beltﬂ, instead of attending the kick-off \nevent onsite. 84 journalists from a list of 100 media shared the \nposter on WeChat.\nBMW GOOD DRIVER &amp; BMW GOOD RIDER \nWe unveiled another online social campaign for National \nTraffic Safety Day, which aligned the My BMW app and \nBMW Motorrad Weibo with regional traffic police to spread \nthe word about our ﬁBMW Good Driverﬂ and ﬁBMW Good \nRiderﬂ traffic safety campaigns. More than 2.96 million peo\n-ple participated in the event.\nWe have long focussed on traffic safety education as a par\n-ticipant in the China Road Traffic Safety Charity Alliance and \nthrough our BMW Good Driver initiative.

To date, we have engaged more \nthan 13,200 people to endorse BMW™s advocacy.\nIn addition to our online innovations around child traffic safety \neducation, we also upgraded our in-person events, bringing our \nnew CTSE pop-up event to Chongqing and Shenyang during \n2020. We included our ﬁBMW Good Driverﬂ and ﬁBMW Good \nRiderﬂ initiatives in the interactive photography zone we created \nto broaden the social impacts of our campaign.

In 2020, we continued to build \non the CTSE Ambassador Training Base we launched in 2019, \nwhich engages our BMW dealers and car owners with our phi\n-losophy of safety and responsibility. We provide our dealers \nwith toolkits and training manual to enable car owners to lead \nchildren\'s road-safety courses, and by the end of 2020, it has \nbecome one of the most popular CSR activities for our dealers: \nFrom 35 training bases in 19 cities, we had 886 volunteers lead \nchildren™s road-safety courses for 7,050 beneficiaries.\n\n112\n111In 2020, facing the challenges of the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, BMW China Cul\n-ture Journey demonstrated our firm \ncommitment to support society™s re\n-covery and resilience. During the pan\n-demic, our Culture Journey took timely \naction and launched the online Intan\n-gible Cultural Heritage Pop-up Store \nto help inheritors in Hubei to overcome \nthe tough period. \nAs the epidemic eased, we paid an in-\ndepth visit to and held an exhibition in \nLiaoning to give back the hometown of \nBMW Brilliance, to strengthen our con\n-nection with the local community, and \nhelp to promote the recovery of the cul\n-ture and tourism industry in Liaoning. \nTRACE THE ROOT OF LIAOHAI \nCULTURE\nThemed "Trace the Root of Liaohai \nCulture, a Spiritual Homeland of Con\n-tinuity and Preciousness", in 2020 \nwe embarked on a four-day tour that \nexplored, promoted, and safeguarded \nintangible cultural heritage (ICH). \nWe visited more than 30 representative \nICH items, including the Xiu Yan Man\n-chu Paper-Cut, the Haicheng Stilt, and \nthe Panjin Municipal Fisherman™s Work \nChant.

With our comprehensive \nhygiene plans and options for working from home, we o˜er our \nemployees optimum protection to see us safely through the \nCovid-19 pandemic together.\nThe ˚rst half of 2020 was marked by local lockdowns, temporary \nproduction stoppages, plant closures and short-time working. \nTowards the middle of the year, a reversal was seen in the trends \nfor customer demand and production: as a result, Group sales\n for 2020 as a whole were around 15% lower year-on-year at\n • 4.1 billion. Thanks to the gradual recovery of our business per\n-formance in the second half of the year, earnings and free cash \n˛ow also improved step by step.  \nDespite this extremely di˝cult environment, we also made \nsigni˚cant progress in 2020 in many other areas. \nThe 2020 ˜nancial year was an extraordinary year in \nwhich LEONI also faced a number of novel challenges. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic impacted virtually every \naspect of our business, and forced us to rethink and \nreshape extensively in many di˚erent areas. \nFOREWORD\n\n55This Communication on Progress provides a traditional review\n of the 2020 ˚nancial year as well as a brief overview of our forth-\ncoming pipeline of sustainability activities. \n Nuremberg, July 2021\nLEONI AG\nBoard of Directors\n   Aldo Kamper\n  \n          Ingrid Jägering\n Chief Executive O˝cer (CEO)\n           Chief Financial O˝cer (CFO)\n   Excellent progress was also made in implementing our strategy \nand performance programme VALUE 21. The measures for cost-\ncutting and improving e˝ciency in this programme had been \nlargely implemented by the end of the third quarter of 2020, and \ntherefore earlier than planned. A rolling follow-up process is now \nin place, while new measures will also be introduced on a continu\n-ous basis to further improve performance and e˝ciency.\nLEONI™s strategic realignment also advanced further during the \n2020 ˚nancial year. The WCS (Wire &amp; Cable Solutions Division) has \nbeen split into organisational units that will be sold in the context \nof a partial sale scenario. Within WSD (Wiring Systems Division), \nwhich will be a particular point of focus for LEONI in the future, \nnew projects were selected by prioritising strategic customer \nrelationships Œ and pro˚tability criteria in particular Œ so as to\n increase long-term earning capacity. In addition, during the \nreporting year we prepared an organisational realignment with \ne˝cient, functional structures. The fact that we are Europe™s lea\n-ding supplier in the wiring systems sector signi˚cantly improves \nour opportunities in the ˚eld of electromobility and autonomous \ndriving.\nWe have implemented our planned integration of sustainability \nmanagement with Corporate Ethics, Risk &amp; Compliance, and initial \nmeasures to improve e˝ciency are now bearing fruit.\nIn 2020, we ˚rmly believe that LEONI has adopted the right \napproach to stabilising business development over the long term. \nThe aim is to further improve operational performance, to place \nourselves on a sound ˚nancial footing for the long term and to get \nthe company solidly back on track.\nDespite the di˝cult market conditions, we continue to pursue our \nmeasures to ensure sustainable corporate governance. As a UN \nGlobal Compact participant, this also means driving continuous \nimprovement with regard to the UN Global Compact Ten Princip\n-les and the UN Global Compact™s Sustainable Development Goals. \nIn doing so, we aim to ensure an appropriate balance between \neconomic orientation and our social and ecological responsibility.\nFOREWORD\n\n66LEONI is a global provider of products and solutions \nfor energy and data management in the automotive \nsector and other industries.\nThe value chain encompasses wires, optical ˜bers, \nstandardised cables and special cables through \nto custom-developed wiring systems and related \ncomponents as well as services.\nAs an innovation partner and solutions provider, \nLEONI supports its customers with pronounced \ndevelopment and systems expertise.\nAs of 31 December 2020, our listed LEONI Group \nemployed around 101,000 people in 30 countries \nand generated Group sales of • 4.1 billion in 2020.\nLEONI™s business is handled by two company\n divisions (segments).\nTHE LEONI GROUP\n\nFor detailed information about the structure, strategy and competitive \nsituation of the LEONI Group and its two divisions, please refer to the \n  Annual Report 2020\n.77The \nWIRE &amp; CA\nBLE \nSOLUTIONS DIVISION ˜WCS˚\n is a leading manufac\n-turer of wire and cable systems. The Division™s portfolio comprises \nwires, strands and optical ˚bers, standardised lines, special \ncables and fully assembled systems as well as related services \nfor customers in a wide range of industries and industry sectors, \nincluding automotive, capital goods, medical devices, telecom\n-munications, energy and infrastructure. WCS is already focusing \non technologically sophisticated products and customer-speci˚c \napplications for both the automotive sector as well as industrial \nniche markets.\nThe two divisions are structured di˜erently and are active in \ndi˜erent market environments. To ensure they can fully realise \ntheir potential, they will follow separate development paths in \nthe future. Accordingly, LEONI will focus primarily on the wiring \nsystems business and plans to divest itself of the WCS Division.\nThe \nWIRING SYSTEMS DIVISION ˜WSD˚\n is one of the world™s leading \nproviders of complete wiring systems and customer-speci˚c \ncable harnesses for the automotive industry. This Division™s range \nof products and services includes developing and producing \nsophisticated cable harnesses and integrated wiring systems, \nhigh-voltage (HV) wiring systems for hybrid and electric vehicles, \npower distribution components and special connectors.\nAs a systems provider, we cover the entire spectrum from concep\n-tual design through to volume production as well as supplemen\n-tary services. We are also increasingly positioning ourselves as a \nsolutions provider for in-vehicle data and energy management, so \nas to supply our customers with innovative products and services \nfor the automotive megatrends of electromobility, connectivity \nand autonomous driving. In order to expand our position as a \nsystems provider, we are also strengthening our expertise in the \nareas of electronics and software.\nLEONI\nSales: • 4.1 billion; Employees: approx. 101,000\nWIRING SYSTEMS\n  Sales: • 2.5 billion;\n Employees: approx. 92,600 \nWIRE &amp; CABLE SOLUTIONS\n   Sales: • 1.6 billion;\n Employees: approx. 8,100 \nLEONI GROUP AND DIVISIONS 2020\nTHE LEONI GROUP\n\n88ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT\nSTRATEGIC \n ORGANISATION\nSustainability Steering Committee\nMembers:\nBoard of Directors and divi-\nsional senior management\nTasks:\n Strategic orientation and \ndecisions on long-term \nsustainability issues\nSustainability Panel\nChairperson:\nHead of Corporate Ethics,\n Risk &amp; Compliance \n(until November 2020:\n VP Corporate Sustainability)\nMembers:\nHeads of Ethics, Risk &amp; Com-\npliance, HR, Communication \nManagement and Safety, \nHealth &amp; Environment\nTasks:\n Prioritisation of sustainability \nissues and support for the\n strategic decision-making \nprocess and sustainability \nreporting\nOPERATIONAL \n ORGANISATION\n Sustainability Working Groups\nMembers:\nSpecialists from various \ndepartments\nTasks:\n Implementation of projects \nand processes to achieve \nsustainability goals\nSustainability management\nLEONI introduced a Group-wide Sustainability Management unit \nin 2016: this unit is responsible for the strategic further develop\n-ment of all of the LEONI Group™s sustainability activities, as well \nas for uniform, Group-wide reporting. Our 2030 CSR Strategy has \nbeen in e˜ect since 2019. The programme provides a strategic \nframework for the comprehensive, structured and systematic fur\n-ther development of key non-˚nancial topics at LEONI. In light of \nthe dynamic nature of sustainability management as a discipline, \nlegislative developments and the growing requirements of our \nstakeholders, we will conduct a fundamental review of our sus\n-tainability strategy and our activities in 2021 as part of a strategy \nand implementation project and make any necessary adjustments. \nOne particular focus here is an updated climate strategy.\n Last year, we were able to continue with our primary sustainability \nmanagement activities despite the pressures from the Covid-19 \npandemic.\nIn the reporting year, the Corporate Sustainability remit was \nabsorbed into the new Corporate Ethics, Risk &amp; Compliance \ndepartment as a Sustainability Management system, as part of \nthe VALUE 21 programme. This enables us to better integrate risk \nand opportunity management with compliance and sustainability \nissues, as well as integrated reporting.\nSUSTAINABILITY AT LEONI\nORGANISATION OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT IN THE LEONI GROUP\nEcological \n responsibility\nCSR STRATEGY\nTargets 2030\nEconomic \n responsibility\nStandards and guidelines\nStrategic development of sustainability aspects\nSocial\n responsibility\nMajor topics\n\n99MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 2020\nLEONI STAKEHOLDERS\nStakeholders and key aspects\nLEONI™s global activities impact on various external and internal \nstakeholder groups. In particular, these include our customers, \nemployees, investors, suppliers and other business partners, as \nwell as legislators and authorities in the countries in which we \noperate. The needs of these groups are accounted for by our \nsustainability strategy and form part of decision-making about \nthe materiality of individual aspects (materiality analysis).\nBased on the requirements of the German Sustainability Code \nand the GRI standard, aspects of material importance to LEONI™s \nbusiness are reviewed annually and new topics are also de˚ned \nas necessary. Key elements of this review included a benchmark \nanalysis, talks with internal and external stakeholders, and \nan evaluation of sustainability questionnaires completed by \nour customers. The review process was also guided by the ten \nprinciples of the UN Global Compact as well as the United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals, with the aim of prioritising \ntheir relevance and impact on our business activities (materiality \nanalysis). Two perspectives are taken into account here: \n  //Relevance of aspects for LEONI\n  //Relevance of aspects for external stakeholders\nIn the 2020 reporting year, the review of our materiality analysis \ndid not produce any new, signi˚cant results.

Our aim is to reconcile the various requirements that \narise in these three separate domains. In adopting this approach, \nwe seek to ensure stability, secure the future of our company, and \ncontribute to the sustainable development of the economy and of \nsociety at large. This present report is also oriented on these three \npillars of our sustainability strategy.\nECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\nWe have set ourselves the goal of ensuring our \nlong-term market success, and thereby creating \nvalue for our shareholders and stakeholders. \nOur dedication and our adherence to stringent \ncompliance standards enable us to maximise\n bene˚ts for our customers by achieving \nexcellence in quality and service. We develop \nand manufacture technically mature products \nand solutions that are increasingly deployed in \nenvironmentally friendly technologies.\nECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWe consider climate and environmental \nprotection to constitute a key corporate goal, \nand strive to keep the impact of our activities \non the natural world to an absolute minimum. \nOur environmental initiatives work to improve \nour handling of water, energy, natural resources \nand materials in our plants on a continuous \nbasis. Our production facilities are now increa\n-singly certi˚ed to international standards such \nas ISO 14001, EMAS and ISO 50001.\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nWe consider the following to be essential: \ndiversity, employee satisfaction, equal opportu\n-nities and safe working conditions that are free \nof prejudice. In all of our activities worldwide, \nwe comply in full with the requirements of \nthe United Nations™ International Labour \nOrganisation (ILO), call on all of our business \npartners to uphold our social standards, and are \ncommitted to respecting and defending human \nrights. LEONI also supports and ˚nances a \nnumber of social projects around the world. We \nalso prioritise compliance with OSH standards \nfor the protection of our employees.\nTHE THREE PILLARS OF SUSTAINABILITY AT LEONI\nCSR Strategy 2030 \n Adopted in 2019, our CSR Strategy 2030 establishes a strategic \nframework that supports the comprehensive, structured and \nsystematic development of key non-˚nancial aspects at LEONI \nup until 2030. The framework includes de˚nitions of targets, \nmeasures and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the individual \ntopics. These topics include employee-related issues, environ\n-mental issues, upholding human rights and compliance.\n The interim review of our issues and their associated targets \nplanned for 2020 has been postponed to 2021. The targets and \ntarget achievement are described in detail in the following \nchapters.\nSUSTAINABILITY AT LEONI\n\n1111As part of risk analysis work, risks and opportunities\n are systematically identi˜ed at an early stage.\n Signi˜cant risks and opportunities are analysed and \nassessed in terms of their probability of occurrence \nand quantitative e˚ects. Our risk analysis process also \nconsiders material risks of relevance for sustainability. \nRisk assessment involves the analysis of reported \nnon-˜nancial risks from operational business together \nwith abstract risks as de˜ned by a team of experts. \nThese identi˜ed abstract risks are already recorded \nin our Risk Management System and integrated into \nthe risk process. According to our current assessment, \nno highly probable risks of this nature exist with the \npotential to have a severely negative impact.\nRisk Management System\nFor further details of our current Risk Management System and the reporting \nof all major risks, please see the summary provide in the section risk and \nopportunity report of the  \n Annual Report 2020\n.ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1212RISK OF CORRUPTION WITHIN THE COMPANY\nTarget\nKPI\nActual 2020\ne-Learning course on anti-corruption completed by more than 90%\nRatio of completed training sessions to invited sta˜/year\n92 % \nLiving Code Quiz more than 90% completed\nRatio of completed training sessions to invited sta˜/year\n76\n % \nCompliance management and anti-corruption e˛orts\nWith the aim of complying with laws and avoiding corruption, \nLEONI requires all of its employees to demonstrate integrity, \nresponsibility, and deference to rules and regulations. Corres-\n ponding provisions are set out in the LEONI Code of Conduct \nand the Anti-Corruption Compliance Guidelines. Revisions to our \nAnti-Corruption and Bribery Policy were made in the reporting \nperiod. LEONI operates a Compliance Management System in \norder to enforce and monitor compliance with this policy. A \nCompliance Management Dashboard, which was introduced a \nfew years ago, has seen regular improvements since then and \nnow includes various modules for a number of separate areas. In \nrelation to anti-corruption and bribery, the following modules \nhave been implemented:\n  //Distribution of policies and training materials\n  //Completion of business partner compliance audits\n  //Documentation and disclosure of con˛icts of interest\n  //Documentation and disclosure of gifts, invitations, donations \nand sponsoring\n Reports of potential violations of internal anti-corruption policies \nor breaches of the law are investigated and prosecuted if the \nreports prove to be well-founded.\nIntroduced in 2017, our Code of Conduct constitutes a funda\n-mental part of the compliance system at LEONI. The Code of \nConduct de˚nes responsible, legally compliant behaviour at \nLEONI, building on the external requirements incumbent on both \nthe company and its employees that result from legislation as \nwell as the demands of our customers and the market. The Code \nof Conduct is anchored by our guiding principle of integrity. \nIntegrity is the basis for value-oriented corporate governance, \no˜ering guidance, a behavioural standard and assistance in our \ndecision-making.\nECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1313The value-related concepts set out in the LEONI Code of Conduct \nare further developed in our ‚Living Code™: this is an internal, \ninteractive information platform that simultaneously serves as \na training platform for the LEONI Code of Conduct. The Living \nCode uses examples, explainer videos, diagrams, checklists and \nlinks, etc. to convey the most important compliance principles to \nemployees, and was updated in the reporting year. The training \ncourse developed for the Living Code also addresses the topic of \nanti-corruption and is mandatory for every active employee with \na Windows account, which corresponds to around 16 percent \nof our workforce. In 2020, training was completed for around \n12,300 (previous year: 13,300) employees, which corresponds to a \nful˚lment rate of 76% (previous year: 73%).\nThe special anti-corruption e-learning course must be completed \nby all new employees after joining the company and then at regu\n-lar intervals of three years. Due to short-time working introduced \nin response to the coronavirus pandemic, the 60-day deadline for \ncompleting the e-learning course was suspended for six months \nin March 2020. This gave participants time until September to \ncomplete their training. In 2020, around 1,800 employees success\n-fully completed the training course (previous year: around 1,500), \nwith a total ful˚lment rate of 92% (previous year: 86%).\nAs a result, both KPIs have continued to improve and the target \nset for the online anti-corruption course KPI was actually \nexceeded.\nAs part of work on our CSR Strategy 2030, we resolved to further \nincrease awareness of compliance both within the company and \namong our suppliers. To this end, the LEONI Code of Conduct for \nBusiness Partners was developed and published in 2019. In 2021, \nadditional measures planned for the implementation of the LEONI \nCode of Conduct for Business Partners will be introduced, such \nas the inclusion of the Code of Conduct in our General Terms and \nConditions of Purchase. \nECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1414Electromobility as an example of sustainable product \ndevelopment\nLEONI uses a wide range of products, system solutions and \nservices that help our business to use energy more e˝ciently and \nconserve resources, thereby reducing emissions and environmen\n-tal pollution. Alternative drive systems that will power transport in \nthe future Œ such as hybrid designs, electric motors and fuel cells Œ\n form an important part of this approach. As one of the market \nleaders in this ˚eld, LEONI is already able to o˜er integrated \nsolutions for high-voltage wiring systems and related infrastruc\n-ture for any alternative drive system Œ from charging cables and \nhigh-voltage lines to complex wiring systems.\nThe status of electromobility at LEONI is clearly illustrated by \nthe volume of cable harnesses for electric and hybrid vehicles as \na proportion of total sales. In LEONI™s Wiring Systems Division, \nthis proportion was no less than 28 percent in 2020. The start of \nproduction for the wiring system used in Volkswagen™s ID.3 was \nalso a key milestone, since this is a car designed as a fully electric \nvehicle. Including both high- and low-voltage cable harnesses, \nthis project covers all of the vehicle™s wiring systems.\n The further development of drive concepts for electromobility \nis a core ˚eld of innovation for the intelligent energy and data \nsolutions to be used in vehicles of the future. Alongside electri˚ed \nmobility, other key areas within this programme are connected \nmobility, autonomous mobility, automated production, and smart \nsolutions and services.\nFrom charging cables and battery management to the complex \nwiring system architecture itself: forward-thinking, high-quality \nand environmentally friendly innovations for the transport \nsystems of the future are fundamental for sustaining LEONI™s \nlong-term growth. In both of our Divisions, we have therefore \nestablished a high-performance innovation unit with the aim of \ndeveloping needs-based solutions in line with new global trends, \nand for use in sustainable, environmentally friendly products and \ntechnologies.\n ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1515LEONI is well aware of its ecological responsibilities \nand regards environmental protection as a key cor-\n porate objective. Our environmental management is \ngeared to keeping the impact of all our processes on \nnature to the absolute minimum.\nWe make every e˚ort to reduce energy consumption \nand our associated greenhouse gas emissions as\n our contribution to climate change mitigation, and\n to achieve a high level of e˛ciency in our use of \nmaterials and resources.\nECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1616We have various initiatives in place to promote a sense of respon\n-sibility for ecological issues among our employees. We also use a \nrange of awareness-raising measures at our facilities with the aim \nof ensuring our employees are properly educated about these \ntopics. LEONI has adopted a precautionary approach to environ\n-mental protection, in accordance with the UN Global Compact. \nEnvironmental protection is therefore anchored in our LEONI Code \nof Conduct as a core corporate objective.\n The respective SHE and environmental protection policies issued \nby our two Divisions also include the following principles of action \nin relation to ecology:\n  //Continuous improvement of measures for occupational health \nand safety, health and the environment.\n  //Reductions to the impact on the environment caused by \nour products and processes, where economically viable and \ntechnically feasible.\n  //E˝cient use of environmental resources and energy.\n  //Prioritising waste avoidance over waste collection and disposal.\n  //Compliance with all duties in relation to occupational health \nand safety, health and the environment (legal/other requi\n-rements). The relevant national standards are our minimum \nrequirements in this context.\nGoals and key performance indicators \nIn 2017, we de˚ned a number of short-term, facility-by-facility \nenvironmental protection targets: these targets were met at all \nplants in the LEONI Group by 2020:\n  //Reduction of energy usage by 1.5 percent\n (baseline: 2016 consumption)\n  //Reduction of relative volume of waste generated by 2 percent \n(baseline: waste volume in 2016)\n In order to achieve these targets, plants were free to de˚ne and \ncomplete one or more projects, so as to accommodate the di˜er\n-ing strategies and infrastructural circumstances applicable to the \nvarious production facilities within the two divisions. We started \nmeasuring target achievement levels internally in 2018.\nThe adoption of the CSR Strategy 2030 marks an expansion to our \ntargets and key ˚gures for environmental protection. Accordingly, \nLEONI has set targets for water and energy consumption as well as \ngreenhouse gas emissions\n1.The following targets are to be achieved by 2030:\n  //Certi˚cation of all production facilities to the ISO 14001 environ-\n mental standard\n  //Reduction of energy consumption by 15 percent per • 1 million \nin sales\n  //Reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\n2 equivalents by 20 percent\n per • 1 million in sales\n  //Reduction in fresh water use by 10 percent per • 1 million in \nsales\n1  Baseline year 2016\nECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1717Certi˝ed management system\nTo create a suitable starting point for ful˚lling these basic princip-\n les and monitoring the ecological impact of our activities, most of \nour facilities operate environmental management systems based \non internationally recognised standards such as ISO 14001, EMAS \nIII and ISO 50001.\nWSD has set itself the goal of certifying all of its operational \nunits to ISO 14001 by the end of 2019. All operational units in the \nrandom sample selected by independent certi˚ers completed the \naudit successfully. The corresponding certi˚cates were issued in \nJanuary 2021.\nThe WCS Division has set itself a long-term goal of having all \nfacilities successively audited to the ISO 14001 standard. During \nthe reporting year, group certi˚cation (which includes 30 facilities) \nwas successfully completed and a corresponding matrix certi˚cate \nŒ which is valid until October 2022 Œ was issued.\nIn line with our CSR strategy, 91 percent of the facilities surveyed \nacross the Group had completed ISO 14001 certi˚cation by the \nbeginning of 2021. In addition, 6 percent of facilities surveyed \nalso conform to the ISO 50001 standard for energy management \nsystems, while a further 7 percent have been audited under the \nEU™s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nTarget\nKPI\nActual 2020\nAll operating LEONI production facilities 100% ISO 14001 certi˚ed\n% certi˚ed facilities\n91 %  \nECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n18\n18\nEnergy and power consumption \nLEONI requires energy for its manufacturing processes and utility \nsystems Œ such as heating, cooling, ventilation and compressed \nair Œ as well as electricity for lighting. In 2020, 487,303 MWh\n2 of \nenergy and electricity were consumed across the Group. This \ncorresponds to a decline of 7 percent in absolute terms com\n-pared to the previous year. In line with our CSR strategy, energy \nconsumption increased by around 6 percent per • 1 million of \nSales compared to 2016. The strong downturn in sales caused by \nCovid-19 produced a de facto increase in energy consumption in \nrelation to sales in the reporting year.\nDespite the pandemic, some LEONI facilities were able to \nstart new energy e˝ciency projects or continue existing ones \nduring the reporting period. Examples of such projects include \nthe installation of more e˝cient solar panels at the Monticelli \nd™Ongina facility (Italy), and the conversion to LED lighting at the \nNaberezhnye Chelny (Russia), Celaya (Mexico), Roth (Gildestraße, \nGermany) and Däniken (Switzerland) facilities. A number of \nfacilities were also able to reduce air pressure from 8 to 6 bar \nin their compressed air supplies, while leaks in compressed air \nsupplies were also identi˚ed at several facilities in Germany. \nOther projects addressed the use of energy-e˝cient water pumps \nand the optimisation of cooling water circuits at the Roth facility \n(Germany), the use of new heat pumps and heat exchangers for \nbuilding heating in Däniken (Switzerland), and the replacement \nof around 400 air-conditioning and heating units at the Montigny \nfacility (France). Other activities are pro˚led in the  \n Climate and \nenvironmental protection projects \nchapter.\nEnergy needs were largely met by purchased electricity (73%)\n and fossil fuels such as natural gas, heating oil and diesel (23%).\n In addition, 2 percent was provided by district heating and\n 2 percent by renewable energy in the form of wood pellets (plants \nin China, Serbia and Ukraine) and land˚ll gas (facility in Germany).\n ENERGY SOURCES AT LEONI \nElectricity\nFossil fuels\nDistrict heating\nRenewable energy sources\n23\n %73\n %2 %2 %ENERGY AND POWER CONSUMPTION  \nSpeci˚c (MWh/• million sales)\nAbsolute (1,000 MWh)\n2020\n2019\n2016\n0 500 1,000\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nTarget\nKPI\nActual 2020\nReduction of energy consumption by 15% percent per • 1 million in sales (baseline year is 2016)\nMW\n h/\n • 1 million in sales\n6 %  \n2  At the time of the audit of the non-˚nancial information statement, energy consumption was 484,030 MWh. \nHowever, there was no material change in the underlying circumstances.\nECOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n1919Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)\n When measuring\n3 our CO\n2 equivalent (CO\n2e) emissions, we include \nemissions from energy and power consumption in production \nprocesses. These processes generate greenhouse gas emissions \nby heating, the supply of steam, surface treatment and cooling \nprocesses. We include direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) \nemissions from 88 production facilities. This number includes all \nrelevant units, namely all research and administrative facilities \nwith more than 50 employees as well as all operational facilities.\nIn 2020, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions together accounted for \n260,654 tonnes of CO\n2 equivalent. The switch to green electricity \nat a German and a Mexican facility has signi˚cantly reduced the \nemissions generated by their energy consumption. In line withour \nCSR strategy, emissions (CO\n2e) increased by 31 percent per\n 1 million of sales compared to 2016,\nEmissions from the combustion of wood pellets and land˚ll gas \namounted to 78 tonnes of CO\n2e4 in 2020.\nAs in the previous year, we report on three Scope 3 categories. In \n2020, Scope 3 emissions totalled 559,655 tonnes of CO\n2e, which \namounts to a year-on-year reduction of 13 percent. As a result of \ntravel restrictions imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, \nemissions in the ﬁbusiness travelﬂ category decreased signi˚cantly \nwhen compared to 2019.\nGHG˝EMISSIONS ˙CO\n2eˆ Speci˚c (\n tCO\n2e/• million sales)\nAbsolute (1.000 tCO\n2e)2020\n2019\n2016\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nCLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION\nTarget\nKPI\nActual 2020\nReduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (CO\n2e) by 20% per • 1 million in sales (baseline year is 2016)\nt CO\n2e / per • 1 million  in sales\n31 % Scope 3 categories\n2019\n2020\nPurchased copper + PVC\n 5626,000\n545.492\n 6  Transmission and distribution of purchased electricity\n16,305 \n13,908\n 7 Business travel\n2,181\n256\n 8 3  Our internal GHG audit is completed according to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\nThe basis for calculating CO\n2e is provided by the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), which are in turn based on \nthe Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) over a period of \n100 years.\n4   Emissions are not included in Scope 1 according to the GHG protocol\n5   Mainly suspension PVC\n6   Emission factor Idematapp LCA database 2020\n7   Emission factor IEA 2020\n8   Emission factor DEFRA 2020.

In 2020, water \nconsumption amounted to 1,645,658 m3. In absolute terms, this \nrepresents a marginal increase of 1 percent compared with the \nprevious year. In line with our CSR strategy, relative consumption \nper • 1 million of sales increased by 35 percent compared with the \n2016 baseline year.\nDuring the course of the year, several measures were initiated or \ncompleted with the aim of reducing local water consumption. \nThese included a new water cooling/heating system for produc\n-tion units (heating pumps), as well as retro˚tting work at several \nfacilities designed to reduce and/or control the supply of water to \ntoilets.

Our products and solutions require the use of various ma\n-terials, and copper and plastics in particular. In 2020, the company \npurchased approximately 140,000 tonnes of copper and 20,850 \ntonnes of PVC. Information about other important feedstocks and \nmaterials used at LEONI can be found in the 2020 Annual Report.\nMost waste that we generate is non-hazardous, like the waste \ngenerated in canteens or o˝ces. A proportion of our waste is \nalso hazardous, and is made up of galvanisation process waste, \noils and lubricants, and coolants for wire-drawing machines, for \nexample. In 2020, the total volume of waste (both non-hazardous \nand hazardous) was 38,926 tonnes, of which 29,265 tonnes (75%) \nwas reused, recovered or recycled. Compared with the previous \nyear, our total waste volume has therefore fallen by almost\n 11 percent in absolute terms.\nVarious measures have led to signi˚cant savings in relation to \nwaste generation. The Safety, Health &amp; Environment (ﬁSHEﬂ) \ndepartment has made signi˚cant progress towards its 2018 Œ 2020 \nSHE Framework Targets at a number of WCS facilities.\nAs one example, ˛ue gas post-combustion capture was deployed \nat a German facility in Halver. This new system has reduced the \nhazardous waste of activated carbon by 100 tonnes per year.\n Optimisations that further reduced waste volumes were also \nmade to the production process at this facility as well as another \nfacility in Poland. Another activity was completed at a Mexican \nfacility in Chihuahua, where repairs made to plastic cones and \nwooden pallets have contributed to the reduction or avoidance\n of waste.

In \naddition, the installation of a central control system for lighting \nin production facilities was initiated at locations in India and \nSlovakia. At a German facility, leaks in the compressed air supply \nwere eliminated by optimising the lubrication of extruder gears. \nThese and other projects have made contributions to reducing \nabsolute energy consumption within the Group.\nDespite several projects aimed at achieving continuous reductions \nin water use, consumption increased year-on-year. Measures such \nas the conversion of toilet ˛ushing systems to systems with lower \nwater consumption at premises in France and Germany or the \ninstallation of sensor ˛ushing in sanitary facilities at a Russian site \nwere unable to compensate for the increase in water consumption \nresulting from an increase in production sta˜, as well as the \nmore stringent hygiene practices introduced in response to the \nCovid-19 pandemic.\nAs one example of measures adopted to further improve the \nproportion of energy sourced from renewables, a long-term \nagreement for the use of solar power was signed by a Mexican \nfacility a few years ago.\nOne positive result is the ˚gure for total waste generated, which \nfell sharply in 2020. In addition to the projects already mentioned \nunder ﬁResource e˝ciency and waste generationﬂ, appropriate \nmeasures to raise awareness are also planned at sites such as our \nMoroccan facility in Casablanca to further reduce waste genera\n-tion in the future.\nECOLOGICAL\n RESPONSIBILITY\n\n25252020 ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS                                 \nProjects\nCountry\nDescription\nFacility \nsavings*\nEnergy savings\nGermany\nOptimisation of extruder gear lubrication and elimination of leaks in compressed air supply\n1 %Replacement of production unit lighting with LED systems\n29\n %France\nReplacement of production unit lighting with LED systems\n7 %India\nInstallation of a daytime timer switch in factory lighting\n6 %Mexico\nReplacement of production unit lighting with LED systems\n1 %Russia\nReduction of electricity consumption by replacing the main production lighting with LED lighting\n21 %Slovakia\nInstallation of a central control system for ceiling lights in production areas.\n6 %Water savings\nChina\nInstallation of a manual valve to control the water supply\n30\n %Germany\nToilet ˛ush system conversion (system with reduced water consumption)\n6 %France\nToilet ˛ush system conversion (system with reduced water consumption)\n8 %Russia\nInstallation of sensor ˛ush systems in sanitary facilities\n16 %Renewable energy\nFrance\nIncrease in proportion of renewable energy from energy supplier\n6 %Mexico\nUse of solar power by agreement signed with Los Santos Solar I\n54\n %Waste management\nChina\nProcess improvements in cable production to reduce PVC consumption\n336\n %Recycling of used wooden pallets\n17 %Mexico\nRepairs to plastic cones and wooden pallets in order to reduce or avoid waste\n1 %Poland\nInstallation of a dedicated evaporator machine to reduce emulsion waste\n20\n % * Compared with 2016 or next available baseline year\nECOLOGICAL\n RESPONSIBILITY\n\n2626As always, LEONI strives to o˚er its employees \ninteresting work that involves a high degree of \nindependent responsibility within a motivating, \nsupportive and constructive environment. As an\n employer, LEONI seeks to attract competent and \ncommitted sta˚, and to retain these employees over \nthe long term. As before, diversity and employee \nsatisfaction constitute key factors for ensuring the \nfuture success and viability of our company.\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n2727Diversity\nWe view diversity Œ in terms of gender, age, cultural background, \nethnicity, and professional experience and world view Œ as the \nkey to being able to successfully manage an increasingly complex \nset of tasks and challenges within heterogeneous teams. Our \nfocus here is at the top management level, especially in terms of \npromoting and ensuring an appropriate level of participation for \nwomen, as well as boosting internationalisation and making it \neasier for employees to move between departments and job roles.\nIn line with our CSR Strategy 2030, we have set ourselves the goal \nof increasing the proportion of women at the two most senior \nlevels of management (levels 1 and 2) to around 20 percent by \n2030. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain the well-balanced \nproportion of women in the workforce. We also intend to signi˚\n-cantly increase the proportion of non-German nationals in senior \nmanagement roles by 2030.\nIn 2020, 6.3 percent (previous year: 5.6%) of top management po\n-sitions in the LEONI Group worldwide were held by women. At the \nend of the reporting period, one of the three members of LEONI™s \nBoard of Directors was a woman. At the end of the reporting year, \napprox. 55 percent of LEONI™s workforce worldwide was female \n(previous year: 54%).\nIn 2020, we were unable to implement most of our measures \naimed at promoting women to top management positions Œ such \nas targeted skills training for high-potential women Œ as a result of \nthe Covid-19 pandemic. Some measures were implemented only \nin online formats with signi˚cant limitations. Nonetheless, our \npersonnel advisors naturally remain tasked with the identi˚cation \nand presentation of suitable female candidates for all of our \nvacancies.\nInternational experience and periods of residency abroad form \na key element of our management development programme \nŒ especially for positions in senior management.

A general prohibition of discrimination is therefore \nmentioned explicitly in our Code of Conduct and LEONI™s Social \nCharter. In addition, the Social Charter stipulates that support is to \nbe provided for employee skills training and Œ as a minimum re\n-quirement Œ states that compliance is to be ensured with relevant \nnational standards in terms of remuneration and minimum wages, \nhealth, safety and holiday periods.\nIn order to increase LEONI™s attractiveness as an employer, we also \no˜er our employees a set of general conditions that ful˚l the needs \nof their various life situations, such as ˛exible working hours and \nextended opportunities for part-time work or working from home.\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic shaped both the measurement \nand the promotion of employee satisfaction. At a number of \nfacilities, local employee satisfaction surveys were conducted that \naddressed the company™s response to the pandemic and the health \nprotection measures introduced, as well as employee satisfaction \nwith conditions applicable to working from home. The next global \nsurvey of employee satisfaction, which will be used as input for \nderiving speci˚c measures, is planned for 2021.\nEMPLOYEE SATISFACTION\nTarget\nKPI\nActual 2020\nMaintaining willingness to participate in the 1st Group-wide sta˜ survey at about 70%\n *(%) response rate\nSlight increase in the Employment Engagement Index from 76 points to around 80 points\n *Employee Engagement Index\n * The next sta˜ survey will probably be carried out in 2021.\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n2929Changes to working conditions as result of Covid-19 \nWorking conditions at LEONI changed signi˚cantly in response \nto the Covid-19 pandemic. For most employees, the temporary \nclosure of many facilities in 2020 was associated with short-time \nworking hours and/or a leave of absence in order to avoid forced \nredundancies.\nTo minimise risks to their health, employees were also encouraged \nto work from home where possible. To facilitate this change, we \nsigni˚cantly expanded the technical infrastructure needed Œ such \nas VPN capacity Œ at very short notice. The measures we have \nintroduced to support working from home and virtual collabora\n-tion Œ including measures to promote mental and physical health \nat home Œ will be further developed in 2021 and implemented as \nlong-term objectives.\n We also set up a Coronavirus Task Force, responsible for deve-\n loping a comprehensive hygiene plan and implementing it\n immediately at all facilities worldwide in order to provide all \nemployees with optimum protection against infection.\n The plan includes general guidelines and rules of conduct \ncovering social distancing, coughing/sneezing etiquette and \nwork in teams. Face masks and a wide range of disinfection \nresources were also made available to all employees worldwide. \nThe hygiene plan also addresses the need for measures to \nprotect special, high-risk groups within the workforce as well \nas active health management. These measures include speci˚c \nguidance for the workplace commute, especially at facilities \nserved by LEONI™s own bus ˛eet, as well as rules governing access \nto properties and buildings where temperature measurement \nregulations apply. Last but not least, the plan includes rules for \nteam meetings as well as for the design and use of workstations \nin o˝ce and production environments. In the meantime, LEONI \nhas started to vaccinate sta˜ against Covid-19 at many locations \nworldwide Œ e.g. in Egypt, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Rumania, \nRussia and Ukraine.\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n3030Occupational health and safety\nPromoting occupational health and safety, as well as compliance \nwith relevant standards, are key goals set out within the respec\n-tive occupational health and safety, and environment policies \nissued by our two Divisions. The speci˚c principles for action on \noccupational health and safety in these policies were updated in \n2019, and are as follows: \n  //Social and ecological responsibility are core corporate objectives\n  //Occupational health and safety, and environmental protection \nform part of all leadership roles.\n  //Providing safe workplaces and working conditions that protect \nemployee health by helping them avoid work-related injuries \nand illnesses.\n  //Continuous improvement of measures for occupational health \nand safety, and the environment.\n  //Compliance with all duties in relation to occupational health and \nsafety, health and the environment (legal/other requirements). \nThe relevant national standards are our minimum requirements \nin this context.\n  //Creating and promoting mutual trust by engaging in dialogue \nwith all interested parties, and internally with our employees \nand their representatives in particular.\nThe Group-wide SHE strategy, and therefore the work of the \nOneSHE network Œ which comprised the regional SHE managers \nfrom both Divisions and which met once again in the reporting \nyear Œ was successfully implemented. The necessary occupational \nhealth and safety, and environmental activities continue to be \npursued by the operational Divisions.\nWe are increasingly implementing internationally recognised \nstandards in order to ensure the safety and health of our employees.\n In 2020, the transition from OHSAS 18001 to the new ISO 45001 \nstandard was successfully completed, and the Wiring Systems \nDivision™s 45001 matrix was expanded from 29 to 30 locations.\nIn the Wire and Cable Solutions Division, three facilities are now \ncerti˚ed to ISO 45001, the new OH&amp;S standard.\nAccordingly, a total of 38 percent of all facilities surveyed across \nthe Group now have an OH&amp;S management system in place. \nSince 2018, our aim has been to record both workplace accidents \nas well as health and safety activities conducted at the facilities \nincluded in our survey areas of occupational health and safety and \nemergency management across the whole Group. This target was \nachieved in 2020.\nIn line with our CSR Strategy 2030, a new target has now been set:\n maintaining each facility™s accident incident rate and/or achieve \nan improved Group accident incident rate of 0.50 per 100 emplo-\n yees by 2030. To this end, various occupational health and safety \nactivities once again took place in the reporting year, ranging \nOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY\nTarget\nKPI\nActual 2020\n100% AMS certi˚cation of WSD facilities to ISO 45001\n(%) certi˚ed facilities\n82\n % Maintaining the accident rate of 0.5\n# number of accidents at work /\n 100 employees\n0.55\n %100% medical care at all LEONI facilities\n(%) of facilities with medical care\n64\n %SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n3131from safety training to preventive screening programmes, \nwith each facility focusing on issues of particular relevance and \nimportance. In 2020, the incidence rate for workplace accidents \nfell\n9 to 0.55 per 100 employees and approached the target value \nof 0.50 per 100 employees. However, it should be noted that this \n˚gure was a˜ected by the Covid-19 protective measures (short-\ntime working and working from home in particular). A ˚gure for \nmedical care coverage at our facilities was ˚rst set in 2019. This \n˚gure was 64 percent in 2020. \nRespect of human rights \nThe LEONI Group has declared its commitment to uphold interna\n-tionally recognised human rights. We hold our entire management \nteam, all our employees and all our business partners responsible \nfor working to prevent modern slavery and human tra˝cking in our \nbusiness activities. Details are set out in the LEONI Code of Conduct, \nthe LEONI Code of Conduct for Business Partners and the LEONI So\n-cial Charter. In our declaration that commits us to upholding human \nrights, we also expressly state that we do not tolerate any human \nrights abuses and such violations will be unequivocally sanctioned.\nIn November 2020, the LEONI AG Board of Directors launched \nits ﬁHuman Rightsﬂ project. This project aims to develop a due \ndiligence process that e˜ectively meets current and future legal \nrequirements as well as reporting obligations in relation to human \nrights. In addition, measures to prevent human rights violations \nare to be developed and implemented, both within the Group \nas well as by key business partners. The project expands on and \nreplaces the previous ﬁModern Slavery Preventionﬂ programme. \nAs part of this work, the existing whistleblower platform was \nexpanded at the beginning of 2020 to include additional topics \nsuch as discrimination or unlawful working conditions.\nLEONI also requires all of its partners to conduct their business \nsustainably and to uphold human rights at all times. To this end, the \nLEONI Code of Conduct for Business Partners was published in 2019. \nOur standard terms and conditions of business generally require all \nsuppliers to comply with the Social Charter and/or the principles \nof the UN Global Compact. Accordingly, a new supplier for either \nDivision is approved only if they agree to uphold either the UN \nGlobal Compact Guiding Principles or the LEONI Social Charter. In \n2020, the Wiring Systems Division also introduced compliance with \nthe LEONI Code of Conduct for Business Partners as an additional \ncriterion in the evaluation process we use for suppliers of produc\n-tion materials. For the Wire &amp; Cable Solutions Division, this criterion \nwill be included as part of the 2021 supplier self-assessment.\nFurthermore, additional measures planned for the implementa\n-tion of the LEONI Code of Conduct for Business Partners will be \nintroduced in 2021, such as the inclusion of the Code of Conduct \nin our General Terms and Conditions of Purchase. In the event \nof serious and repeated violations of the principles set out in \nthese documents coming to light, LEONI is entitled to terminate \nbusiness relations immediately. No material breaches of these \nprinciples were reported in 2020.\nLEONI also makes every e˜ort to prevent the use of ﬁcon˛ict min\n-eralsﬂ, which are minerals whose extraction involves human rights \nabuses; suppliers are prohibited from supplying any components \ncontaining raw materials supplied by DR Congo or its neighbour\n-ing countries. This prohibition is set out in a Group-wide policy \non con˛ict minerals that is implemented for operational business \nactivities in both divisions. Since 2014, we have voluntarily provid\n-ed interested customers with information complying with the pro\n-visions of the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection \nAct, which states which of our products contain con˛ict minerals \nsuch as gold, tantalum, tin and tungsten from mines or smelting \nworks in certain African countries. To ensure the accuracy of this \nreport, we request the necessary data from our suppliers ever \n9  In accordance with international standards, accidents at work must be reported from the ˚rst day of absence\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n3232year. In this way, we promote the traceability of such materials and \nenhance the transparency of our supply chain, thereby helping \nour customers to meet their own requirements in this area.\nCommunity engagement\n LEONI supports community projects with both donations and \nsponsorships. Key points of focus here are sustainability and \nlocal relevance. Activities are coordinated on the one hand by \na Group-wide sponsorship strategy, which is also supported \nby voluntary coordination e˜orts from individual facilities, to \nensure we meet the speci˚c needs of each particular region. At \nmany of its facilities worldwide, LEONI helps social projects by \nproviding various institutions with donations in kind, for example, \nor supporting local environmental activities. We also maintain \na range of partnerships with universities, technical colleges and \nresearch institutions. In developing and emerging countries \nin particular, LEONI™s facilities make signi˚cant contributions \nin economic terms, thereby helping to combat poverty and \nsupport sustainable development in these countries. In light of \nthe company™s economic situation, the Board of Directors has \ntemporarily curtailed the budget made available for donations \nand sponsorships.\nExertion of political inˆuence\nLEONI does not support any political organisations or parties. \nWe are involved in a number of associations that promote the \ninterests of various industrial sectors. These include the German \nAssociation of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the German \nElectrical and Electronic Manufacturers™ Association (ZVEI), and \nthe Employers™ Associations of the Metal and Electrical Industry \nin Bavaria (Bayme vbm). While LEONI is an active member of \nthese associations, it is not represented in the respective political \nworking groups; our membership therefore does not involve the \nexertion of direct political in˛uence.\n SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n3333Brasil\nSupporting charities for disabled people and institutions for \nchildren\nChina\nAwarding of scholarship grants\nGermany\nGifts from LEONI employees to children (Rummelsberger Jugend\n-hilfestation).

Es ist \nder zehnte. Wo steht Mainova beim \nThema Nachhaltigkeit?Wir sind auf einem guten Weg und \nhaben im Berichtsjahr 2020 beim \nNachhaltigkeits management einige \nWeichen gestellt. An erster Stelle\n stehen hier sicherlich die systema-tische Verzahnung mit unserer\n Strategie —Mainova 2028ﬁ und die \nSchärfung unseres Nachhaltigkeits\n-verständnisses.Was genau bedeutet das?\nNachhaltigkeit wurde als zentrales \n\nstrate gisches Thema in unser Strate-gierad aufgenommen und ist dort nun gemeinsam mit Zusammenarbeit \nund Digitalisierung als Querschnitts-\nthema verankert. Wir stehen in der öko-\nnomischen, ökologischen und sozialen Verantwortung, unser Unternehmen \nzukunftssicher auszurichten: Für unsere \n\nKundinnen und Kunden, für unsere \nMitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter, für\n unsere Heimatregion Frankfurt Rhein\n-\nMain. Nachhaltigkeit hilft uns dabei, \nunsere Vision \n—Erste Wahl für Energie\n-lösungenﬁ zu erreichen.\nUnd inwiefern hat Mainova ihr Nachhaltigkeits-\nverständnis geschärft?Wir orientierten uns weiterhin an fünf Dimensionen: \n\nwirtschaftlicher Erfolg, leistungsfähige Technik, zukunfts\n-fähige Versorgung, faire Partnerschaft und regionale\n Verantwortung. Dabei sind die Sustainable Development \n\nGoals (SDG) der Vereinten Nationen in den Fokus gerückt,\n die uns als Kompass für unser nachhaltiges Handeln dienen. Hier haben wir acht für uns relevante Ziele identi\n-˜ziert, die eng miteinander verwoben sind. Mainova \nmöchte dazu beitragen, diese SDG zu erreichen.

Da werden alle besteh\n-enden strategischen Ziele auf ihren Beitrag zur Nachhaltig\n-keit hin überprüft. Darüber hinaus werden wir aus dem \n\nNachhaltigkeitsmanagement heraus in enger Abstim mung mit den Fachbereichen ein Programm entwickeln, das \n\nebenfalls messbare Ziele enthält.

Insgesamt wollen wir \n\nuns weiter beim Nachhaltig keits-manage ment professionalisieren und \nunternehmensweit messbare Nach\n-haltigkeitsziele entwickeln. Dabei ist \nuns wichtig, unseren Weg von unab\n-\nhängiger Seite begutachten zu lassen. \nDeshalb beteiligen wir uns an Ratings, wie zum Beispiel bei EcoVadis, wo\n wir bereits im vergangenen Jahr gut \nabgeschnitten und auf Anhieb mit \n\nBronze ausgezeichnet wurden. Auch \nBio diversität Œ der Erhalt und die Förderung der Artenvielfalt Œ ist ein \nzentrales Thema. Uns ist es wichtig, \ndie Auswirkungen unserer Geschäfts\n-tätigkeit auf die Umwelt so gering \nwie möglich zu halten. Wir haben uns zur Aufgabe gemacht, uns gezielt \nund wirksam für mehr Bio\n diver sität in \nunserer Region einzusetzen. 2021 \nsind beispielsweise der Bau von Insek-\ntenhotels, das Aufstellen von Bienen-kästen und der Aufbau weiterer \nStorchennester in Planung.

Beim ersten Zeichnungsschluss sammelte Eurazeo die Summe von 80 Mio.\n Euro ein, neben Mainova investierten Unternehmen wie der Automobil\nhersteller \nStellantis oder der deutsche Logistikkonzern Duisport in den Fonds. Der \n—Smart \nCity IIﬁ-Fonds zielt dabei laut Anbieter Eurazeo auf —innovative Digi\n tal unter nehmen, \ndie den gesellschaftlichen Wandel und die damit verbundene Transformation\n von \nStädten unterstützenﬁ. Konkrete Anwendungen sind die Förderung von Homeof˜ce-\nInfrastruktur, Shared Mobility, Elektromobilität, Lieferdiensten, erneuerbaren Energien\n sowie Techniken, die den Ausstoß von CO\n2 reduzieren. Gerade die letzten beiden \nAspekte sind für Städte von einer besonderen Bedeutung: Unter\n suchungen zeigten, \ndass urbane Räume für 78\n % des globalen Energieverbrauchs \nverant wort lich sind \nund mehr als 60 % der weltweiten Treibhausgasemissionen verursachen. \nverspricht? Und falls nein: Was ist die eigent\n-liche Quelle der Lärmbelästigung?ﬁ Der \n Mainova-Experte ist sicher: LoRa\nWAN\n bringt \nTransparenz\n in die Stadt. —Das wird in der \n Zeit nach der Pandemie ein wichtiger Faktor sein. Die Menschen entwickeln mehr und \n mehr das Bedürfnis, wissen zu wollen, was \nbestimmte Maßnahmen tatsächlich bringen.ﬁ\nAUF DEM WEG ZUR DIGITALEN STADT\nGeplant ist auch eine Reihe von Projekten mit \nnamhaften Partnerinnen und Partnern aus der \n\nStadt und der Region. So könnte Mainova ihr \nKnow-how beim Aufbau der Netz-Infrastruktur \n\nauch andere\nn Stadtwerken in Hessen anbieten, \nerste Gespräche laufen. —Der große Vorteil der \n\nLoRaWAN\n- Infrastruktur ist, dass es sich überall dort integrieren lässt, wo Unternehmen, Orga\n-nisationen oder Vereine eigene smarte Lösungen \numsetzenﬁ, sagt Christian Borg-Krebs. Die \n\naktuell von der \nFrankfurter Eintracht vorgestellte\n digital ausgerüstete —Arena of IoTﬁ im Deutsche \nBank Park ist dafür ein Beispiel. Zum Mainova-Netzwerk zählen zudem regionale Unternehmen \n\nwie die Frankfurter Verkehrsgesellschaft (\nVGF) oder der Wohnungsbaukonzern \nABG Frankfurt \nHolding. Fest steht: Das von Mainova aufge-\nbaute LoRaWAN\n-Netzwerk ist ab sofort ein \nzentraler Baustein der Digitalisierungsstrategie \nder Stadt Frankfurt.  WAS IST LORAWAN?\nEin Long Range Wide Area \nNetwork Œ kurz LoRaWAN\n Œ ist eine Funktechnologie, die Daten über große Ent\n-fernungen energieef˜zient, \nkostengünstig und sicher \nüberträgt. Dafür ist kein Breit\n-band-Netzwerk notwendig. \nDie Sensoren senden ihre \nDaten zunächst an ein Gate-\nway. Von dort werden die\n Informationen an intelligente \n\nManagementsysteme weiter-geleitet. Der Energieverbrauch\n der Sensoren ist gering, die \n\nBatterien halten viele Jahre.\n\nBBBBe we gtKapitel 3.0\n41Seite 40 / \nBBBBe we gtKapitel 3.0Bewegt\nMainova AG    Nachhaltigkeit in Bewegung13600 600 8über Jugendhäuser bis hin zum \nUmwelt schutz.

Premiere mit Bronze-MedailleRund 75.000 Unternehmen aus etwa 200 Branchen in 160 Ländern \n\nsind Teil von EcoVadis, einer der renommiertesten Bewertungs-\nplattformen für Nachhaltigkeit. Im Geschäftsjahr 2020 hat auch \nMainova sich zum ersten Mal dem Vergleich gestellt, und das \n\nmit Erfolg: Wir wurden auf Anhieb mit der Bronze-Medaille ausge-\nzeichnet. EcoVadis bewertet Unternehmen anhand der Qualität \n\nihres \nCSR-Managements und fokussiert hierbei auf Umwelt, Menschen- und Arbeitsrecht, Ethik und nachhaltige Beschaffung. \nDie Teilnahme an \nZerti˜zierungen und Ratings ist ein Baustein unseres Nachhaltigkeitsprogramms.

Möglich macht dies \ndie Kooperation mit dem Bikesharing-Anbieter nextbike. Für Mainova wurden \nzwei neue Ausleihstationen errichtet: \n\neine vor der Unternehmenszentrale in \nder Solmsstraße, eine an der Camberger\n Brücke zwischen dem HKW West und \ndem Standort Gutleutstraße 280. Auch \nalle anderen Stationen aus dem next\n-bike-Stationsnetzwerk können genutzt \nwerden. Auslöser für dieses Pilot\n projekt war übrigens ein Vorschlag eines Mit\n-arbeiters in unserem Ideenprogramm \noptinova.Mal eben schnell ein \nRad leihenMinuten \nKOSTENLOS LEIHEN \n FÜR MITARBEITERINNEN \n UND MITARBEITER\n ALLES FLIESSTBester Stromversorger\nDeutschlandsNachhaltigkeit ist eine Voraussetzung, um unsere Vision —Erste Wahl für \nEnergielösungenﬁ zu erreichen. Dabei ist uns wichtig auf Kundenwünsche\n einzugehen. Diese Haltung wird wertgeschätzt: Mainova ist Deutsch\n-lands bester Stromversorger. Dies ergab ein Vergleich von Stromversorgern\n in 175 Regionen der Bundes republik durch das Hamburger Markt\n-forschungs institut Statista im Auftrag von FOCUS-MONEY. Der erste Platz ist —das Ergebnis guter Kundenbewertungen und einer sehr hohen \nPunktzahl im Bereich Kundenservice. Dort weist Mainova die höchste \nWeiterempfehlungsrate unter den Top-Ten-Versorgern aufﬁ, heißt es im \ndazu veröffentlichten Energie-Atlas Deutschland. Im Vorjahr erreichte \nMainova den zweiten Platz. Statista führte die Untersuchung bereits\n zum siebten Mal durch. Für die Studie bewerteten über 9.000 Online-\nTeilnehmerinnen und -Teilnehmer ihre Stromversorger. Statista beurteilt\n die Leistungsfähigkeit anhand von insgesamt 66 Einzelkriterien. Neben \nden Bewertungen durch die Kundinnen und Kunden und deren Weiter\n-empfehlungsbereitschaft ˚ossen in die Untersuchung die Website- und \nServiceangebote der Unternehmen im On- und Of˚ine-Bereich mit ein.\nOb Trinkbrunnen in\n der Frankfurter Innenstadt, \nBaum  p˚anzaktionen für Trink\n-wasserwälder oder der Lehrpfad im \nWasserpark im Frankfurter\n Nordend: \nMainova möchte für einen bewussten \nUmgang mit der wertvollen Res-\nsource\n Trinkwasser sensibili\n sie\nren. \nNun setzt die Kooperation mit dem Senckenberg Naturmuseum bei  der Ausstellung —Flüsseﬁ dieses  Engagement fort. Am Beispiel der \n Nidda werden der Zusammenhang  \nzwischen Geologie und Wasser, \n die Artenvielfalt am Fluss und der \nWasserkreislauf der Region anschau-\nlich erklärt. Mit der Unterstützung der Mainova konnte das Senckenberg Naturmuseum einige außergewöhn-liche, multimediale Exponate kon-zipieren Œ wie zum Beispiel einen begehbaren Wassertropfen oder eine \ninteraktive Simulation des Wasser-\nkreislaufs mit Echtdaten. Die Ausstel-\n\nlung wurde Ende März 2021 eröffnet.\n\nMainova AG    Nachhaltigkeit in Bewegung1313Wir haben uns zur Aufgabe gemacht, \nBiodiversität in unserer Region zu\n fördern. Deshalb kooperiert Mainova \n\nmit der Interessengemeinschaft Kirdorfer Feld \n(IKF). IKF setzt sich als \ngemeinnütziger Naturp˚egeverein dafür \nein, eine Jahrhunderte alte Kulturland-schaft im Norden Bad Homburgs zu \n\nerhalten: das Kirdorfer Feld. Es umfasst \n160 Hektar Streuobstwiesen, Feucht- \nund Trockenwiesen sowie einige kleinere\n landwirtschaftlich genutzte Flächen. \nStreuobstwiesen sind eines der arten\n-reichsten Biotope Deutschlands, auf \n\ndenen bis zu 5.000 Tier- und P˚anzen\n-FASZINOSUM \nSTREUOBST- WIESEarten leben Œ von Insekten wie Bienen, Hummeln und \nWespen bis hin zu Vögeln wie Bachstelze, Grau\n-schnäpper und Zaunkönig. Gerade in Hessen und der \nRhein-Main-Region fördern Streuobstwiesen nicht\n nur die Biodiversität, sondern sind auch ein Kulturgut. \nDenn Streuobst wird unter anderem für die Herstellung\n von Apfelwein verwendet, einem Bestandteil hessischer Lebensart. So vielfältig das Faszinosum Streuobstwiese\n ist, so reichhaltig sind die Ideen, die Mainova und die \nIKF im Rahmen ihrer zunächst auf fünf Jahre angelegten\n Partnerschaft realisieren möchten Œ von Infoveran\n-staltungen über Führungen bis hin zu Einblicken in die Bewirtschaftung der Streuobstwiesen.\nEine Sitzbank ist praktisch. Aber wäre es nicht noch \nviel praktischer, wenn sie nicht nur Menschen Gelegen\n -heit zum Ausruhen geben würde, sondern man\n währenddessen auch seine mobilen Geräte au˚aden \nkann? Nutzerfreundlich mit verschiedenen Techno\n-logien, entweder via USB oder via Induktions-Laden? \nUmweltfreundlich betrieben mit Sonnenenergie?\n Genau diese Funktionen vereint die Solar-Sitzbank \nibench. Mainova hat bereits vier dieser innovativen\n Alltagshelfer und Energielieferanten gespendet und in \nder Region aufgestellt Œ vom Großen Feldberg über\n das Kelsterbacher Mainufer bis hin zu den Taunus-\n\nGemeinden Niedernhausen und Eppstein. Weitere \nibenches für das Jahr 2021 sind in Planung.PAUSE\n  MIT ENERGIEKICK\n\nKapitel 3.0    Bewegt45Seite 44 / \n817\nDie Wärmeversorgung ist eine der zentralen \nGeschäfts tätigkeiten der Mainova. Im über-tragenen Sinn galt dies auch für unser Spenden-jahr 2020. Gleich zwei besondere Projekte\n widmeten sich dem Thema Wärme. In den Winter\n-monaten haben wir 7.500 Euro und mehr als\n 300 Decken an die Diakonie Hessen für ihre Aktion \n—Wärmespendenﬁ, den Kältebus des Frankfurter \nVereins für soziale Heimstätten und den Frankfurter\n Standort der Off Road Kids Jugendhilfe gespendet\n. Auch bei unserer all\n jährlichen Spenden kam pagne zu Weihnachten auf unseren Social-Media-Kanälen \nging es um das Thema Wärme. Bei —#WarmeWorteﬁ\n konnten die Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer \n Botschaften an ihre Liebsten\n hinterlassen. Für jede \nverfasste Nachricht ging ein Euro als Spende an \nden Verein Freunde alter \nMenschen. So kamen \n2.535 Euro zusammen, die wir auf einen Spenden\n-\nbetrag von 5.000 Euro erhöht \nhaben. Der Verein \nFreunde alter Menschen e.\n V. setzt sich gegen die \nVereinsamung älterer Mitmenschen ein und ist \n seit Anfang 2020 auch in Frankfurt am Main aktiv.\nMehr Wärme\nAusgezeichnetWas sind die nachhaltigsten Unternehmen \nDeutschlands? Um diese Frage zu beant-worten, haben das Magazin stern und das \nMarkt forschungsunternehmen Statista \nmehr als 2.000 Firmen analysiert. Insgesamt \nkonnten sich 200 Unternehmen für das \n Ranking quali˜zieren. Mainova landete auf \nPlatz 98 und zählt damit zu den Top 100 der \nnachhaltigsten Unternehmen in Deutsch\n-land. Das Ranking bewertet die Kategorien \nUmwelt, Soziales und Ökonomie anhand \n\nvon über 30 Kennzahlen aus Geschäfts- und \nNachhaltigkeitsberichten. Das Spektrum \nreicht von Treibhausgasemissionen über\n den Frauenanteil in Führungspositionen bis \n\nhin zur Einhaltung des —Deutsche Corporate \nGovernance Kodexﬁ. Zusätzlich haben \n13.000 Menschen in einer Online-Umfrage \n\nangegeben, wie sie die Unternehmen in\n Sachen Nachhaltigkeit in den drei Kategorien\n wahrnehmen. Innerhalb der drei Bereiche \n\nwurden \ndie Kennzahlen mit 70 Prozent und \ndie Umfrageergebnisse mit 30 Prozent\n gewichtet. Das jeweils beste Unternehmen \n\nin einer Kategorie erhielt 100 Punkte. Der \n\nMittelwert über die drei Bereiche ergibt den \nGesamtscore. Die Mainova \nAG erreichte\n 71,8 Punkte.Die Mainova \nAG  \nzählt zu den Top\n 100 der nachhaltigsten  Unternehmen  \nin Deutschland.\n\nMainova AG    Nachhaltigkeit in Bewegung127Nachhaltigkeit hat viele Facetten. Mainova verfolgt dabei einen \ndezentralen Ansatz. Im Dialog \nmit den Fach bereichen sollen im gesamten Unternehmen \nmessbare Nachhaltigkeitsziele \n\nde˜niert werden. So haben wir \n\nauch in der Mitarbeiterrestau\n-ration Potenziale für mehr Nach-haltigkeit identi˜ziert. —Wir \nmöchten im Jahr 2021 die Quote unserer regionaler Lieferanten \nauf 70 % steigern und den Ver\n-packungsabfall um mindestens \n50 % reduzierenﬁ, sagt Abtei\n-lungsleiter Maik Templin. Für ihn \nund sein Team im Mit\n arbeiter-restaurant —New Energyﬁ in der \nUnter nehmens zentrale in der \nSolmsstraße ist das Thema Nach-Regional stärken\nhaltig keit nicht neu. So nimmt Mainova regelmäßig an der \nKlima gourmetwoche der Stadt Frankfurt teil, deren Ziel es ist, \nklimafreundliche Ernährung\n erfahrbar zu machen. Um die \nTo-go-Becher zu reduzieren, \n\nwurden an mehreren Mainova-\nStandorten sogenannte —Tas\n sen  -schränkeﬁ aufgestellt. Die simple, aber wirksame Idee: \nMitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter \n\nbringen nicht mehr benötigte \n\nTassen von zu Hause mit, die an \n\nden Mainova-Standorten einen \nFundus formen, aus dem sich \njeder bedienen kann. Und last \nbut not least ist das —New Energyﬁ\n seit Januar 2021 Bio-zerti˜ziert.-50-50Prozent\nREDUZIERUNG DES VERPACKUNGSABFALLS IN DER \n MITARBEITERRESTAURATION\n ALS ZIELVerwaltungsgebäude, Schulen, Kitas, Museen, der Palmengarten,\n städtische Kliniken: Auch die Stadt Frankfurt braucht Energie\n für ihre Gebäude. Per europaweiter Ausschreibung suchte die \nMainmetropole im Jahr 2020 einen Partner für die Energiebelie\n-ferung für rund 180 Gigawatt Strom und mehr als 200 Mega\n-\nwattstunden Gas. Den Zuschlag im Wettbewerb erhielt Mainova. \nVertriebsmanager Frank-Peter Dill sagt: —Frankfurt und uns\n verbindet bei der Energiebelieferung eine stabile Partnerschaft. \nDiese setzen wir gemeinsam fort. Wir sorgen mit unserer Energie\n dafür, dass Computer in der Stadtverwaltung laufen, Smart-\nBoards in den Klassenzimmern funktionieren und die Lieblings\n-orte der Frankfurterinnen und Frankfurter beheizt sind.ﬁ Der \n\nneue Vertrag trat am \n1. Januar 2021 in Kraft. Der Strom für die \nrund 2.500 Lieferstellen bei rund 60 kommunalen Einrichtungen \nstammt aus hochef˜zienter Kraft-Wärme-Kopplung aus unserem\n Müllheizkraftwerk und klimaneutralem Ökostrom. Einen Teil des \nÖkostroms bezieht die Stadt erstmals direkt als Power Purchase\n Agreement aus \neinem Windpark in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. \nIm Vergleich zum herkömmlichen deutschen Strommix entlastet \ndie Stadt Frankfurt am Main dank der Kombination von KWK- und Ökostrom das Klima jährlich um insgesamt rund 63.350 Tonnen \nCO2.

To our Shareholders\n 5 \nCEO-LETTER  DEAR SHAREHOLDERS\n, \nI hope this letter finds you healthy and in good spirit despite all the negative impact of \n COVID\n-19. 2020 was surely a very difficult year for all of us \n- \nfor me it was \ndefinitely the most \ndifficult year in my life.\n We started the year 2020 with a very positive feeling: we had a very solid order book, our sales at \nthe end of 2019 were strong, our new products were very well received and the start in January \n\nwas also posit\nive.\n Then COVID\n-19 hit the city of Wuhan in China and we immediately set our focus on securing our \nsupply chain as approx. 30% of our sourcing is done in the country as well as on reducing the \ndamage from the \nÒshutdown\nÓ \nof physical retail in China. During \nthe first two weeks, we did not \neven think that this would turn into a global pandemic.\n It then became obvious that COVID\n-19 was unfortunately spreading globally and that we were in a \nsituation we had never been in before. We were in the middle of a worldw\nide pandemic in which \nbasically all physical retail stores selling sports and sports\n-inspired products had to shut down \nglobally during the months of March and April. \n Back then we quickly focused on three main areas: Deal with COVID, continue to drive the\n business and continue to do the right thing, such as focusing on Sustainability and #REFORM.\n  ! !BJ¯RN GULDEN\n CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PUMA\n \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! To our Shareholders\n 6 \nDeal with COVID\n meant first and foremost to ensure the \nhealth and safety\n of our people. Among \nother things, this included the following measures: organize work\n from home wherever possible, \nset up digital communication tools, buy and distribute masks for our employees, organize regular \ntesting (PCR and Quick Tests), sanitize our working spaces on a regular basis, install health and \n\nsafety equipment in all our sto\nres and in general do whatever we could to ensure that our PUMA \nemployees felt as good and safe as possible. I am very proud of how our People &amp; Organization \n\nteams (previously called Human Resources) around the world worked and organized all these \n\nmeasures\n. So far, we have been lucky: none of our almost 16\n,000 employees has died of COVID\n-19 and \nÒonly\nÓ \nfour colleagues were hospitalized, but recovered 100% and are fully back to work.\n The second priority was to secure \nfinancing and liquidity\n. The uncertainty around the pandemic \nand its impact on our business has made us act quickly to secure as much financing as possible. \n\nWe did not know if the lockdowns would last one month, two months or even longer. We prepared \n\nfor a \nÒworst case scenario\nÓ \nof a four\n-month lockdown and managed to get financing that would \nÒkeep us aliveÓ throughout this period. A consortium of twelve banks led by the German state\n-owned \nKreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau\n (KfW) gave us an additional credit line of \n! 900 million \n- \ntogether with existing credit facilities this provided us with a total financing of around \n!1,800 million. \n We never used this additional credit line and it has been replaced by other credit facilities in the \n\nmeantime. The K\nfW-\nled credit line was not a \nÒgift\nÓ \nby the German state. It was a regular credit \nline for which we paid high, above\n-market fees for availabi\nlity and that gave the K\nfW preference \ncompared to other creditors. Nevertheless, this credit line was crucial for us because it gave us \n\nsecurity and allowed us to make sound business decisions in a time of high uncertainty. I would \n\nlike to thank the K\nfW an\nd the other eleven banks for their fast and unbureaucratic processes, and \nfor making this \nÒlife insurance\nÓ \navailable to us.\n The third priority was to quickly find solutions to continue working upstream with our \nretail \npartners\n and downstream with our \nsuppl\niers\n. Our objective was to avoid high cancellations that \ncould have caused massive problems for our suppliers including the loss of thousands of jobs \n\namong their employees. We offered all our retail partners delayed deliveries and extended \n\npayment terms. W\ne slowed down shipments, asked our suppliers to slow down their production \nwithout laying o\nff people and to extend payment terms by one month. We agreed to hold some \ninventories in the factories, some in temporary warehouses in Asia and of course in our nor\nmal \nwarehouses. Most retailers agreed to this approach and I am very proud that we managed to get \nthrough 2020 with cancelling less than 1% of our orders with our suppliers. We continue to work \nwith all of our suppliers and none of them had to lay off work\ners due to the crisis. \n As most physical retail stores had to shut down globally in March and April, the \neCommerce \nchannels\n became even more important. Our focus was to strengthen our own puma.com \nchannel, the marketplaces, the pure eCommerce players, but \nalso the eCommerce channels of \nour Brick &amp; Mortar retail partners. This caused massive changes in our marketing activities with \nbudget shifts to performance marketing and significant pressure on our logistics to service the \nincreased eCommerce demand. I am\n very pleased on how quickly and flexible both our marketing \nand logistics teams acted during this turbulent time.\n ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! To our Shareholders\n 7 \nWe also \ncontinued to drive the business\n during this period. This meant maximizing our sales \nshort-term while at the same time investing int\no the development of new product ranges and \nstrong marketing in order to continue the positive mid\n-term momentum for the brand. We did \neverything to please and service our retail partners in the best way possible, we rather gave deep \ndiscounts instead of b\nuilding excess inventories, we continued to develop full new collections for \n\nthe year 2021 and used the marketing opportunities that will benefit PUMA mid\n-term while we \nreduced our overall marketing spent. During the crisis, we signed football icon Neymar \nJr., the \nmost exciting rookie in the NBA LaMelo Ball, the currently most popular female artist Dua Lipa \nand the very youth culture relevant DJ Snake. All these exciting additions to the PUMA family \nwere done because we are confident that they will further \nstrengthen the relevance of our brand \nboth during the pandemic and also later in the \nÒnew normal\nÓ.  I am very thankful that our supervisory board showed us their trust and support by allowing us to \n\ndo these investments in the middle of the year.\n We also continued to focus on what we call \nÒdo the right thing\nÓ. This includes both our \nsocial \nresponsibility\n and the \nenvironmental sustainability\n of our business practices. We want to be a \ngood corporate citizen and have a positive impact on our society a\ns a whole. As part of our \n#REFORM\n platform, we focused on three main aspects: \ngender equality\n, an \nend to systematic \nracism\n and LGTBQ+ rights\n. Everybody on this planet should be treated equally and we at PUMA \nwant to do our part to fight any form of discrim\nination. Sustainability also continued to be a key \nfocus area for us, and we strive to leave the planet to our children in a better condition than we \ninherited it from our parents. In 2020, we launched our \n10FOR25 sustainability targets\n which will \nguide ou\nr ambitious sustainability actions until 2025. We also continue to support the UN Global \nCompact and its 10 principles for sustainable development. We also launched multiple \nsustainable product collections as well as our new \nFOREVER BETTER\n communication pl\natform. \nBoth responsibility and sustainability are and will continue to be an important part of PUMAÕs \n\nvalues.\n After a very difficult second quarter during which most of the markets had either lockdowns or \nother restrictions, we experienced a very strong t\nhird quarter. In the third quarter, our Net Sales \nincreased by 13.3% (in constant currency) to \n! 1,583 million \nÐ \nthe highest revenue PUMA has \never had in a quarter \nÐ \nand the third quarter EBIT of \n! 190 million \n(12% of Net Sales) shows the \npotential of our \ncompany. The fourth quarter started with 25% growth in October before new \nrestrictions, especially in Europe, slowed our revenue growth once again. We ended the fourth \nquarter with Net Sales being up 9.1% (in constant currency) and an EBIT of \n! 63 million \n(+15% vs \nlast year).\n The full financial year 2020 was ÒdestroyedÓ mainly due to the terrible second quarter, but I hope \nthat the strong second half of 2020 demonstrated the continued momentum of PUMA. We are \n\nvery optimistic about the future of both the spo\nrts industry and for PUMA. During the pandemic, \nwe have seen that the consumers continued to buy our products, queued up in front of the \nsneaker stores when they reopened, started to do more individual sports and we foresee team \nsports to \nÒexplode\nÓ \nagain o\nnce the restrictions will be lifted. We see a continued trend for \nsportive casual wear both in footwear and apparel, comfort being more and more important to \n\nthe consumer and sports brands still being in strong demand across all markets.\n ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! To our Shareholders\n 8 \nWhile we do not \nhave a \nÒcrystal ball\nÓ, we clearly foresee that the pandemic will continue to have a \nnegative impact on our business also in 2021. We believe that the negative impact will be \nstrongest in the first half and believe that it will weaken during the second half\n. Given the \nuncertainty around the future development of the pandemic, we do not feel comfortable giving \nyou a specific financial outlook for the full year. But as of today, \nwe expect that 2021 will be a \nbetter financial year than 2020, both in terms of Ne\nt Sales and EBIT\n. \nLet us hope that 2022 will be a \nÒnew normal\nÓ \nyear.

To our Shareholders\n 9 \nREPORT BY THE \nSUPERVISORY BOARD\n  DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,\n In the financial year 2020, PUMA had to overcome unique and unforeseeable challenges due to the COVID\n-19 pandemic. In particular, the negative effect on our full\n-year revenue and earnings due to closed retail \nstores al\nl over the world and the uncertainty regarding the future development, forced us to withdraw our \nguidance for the financial year 2020 in March 2020. However, thanks to the strategy and actions of PUMAÕs \n\nManagement Board and the dedication of all our employ\nees, we managed to mitigate the negative impact of \nthe COVID\n-19 pandemic without hindering our mid\n-term growth momentum. We protected the health and \nsafety of our employees, ensured sufficient financial liquidity, worked very closely with our suppliers to \nstabilize the supply chain, drove additional sales wherever possible and continued to be a reliable and \nflexible business partner. The Management Board, in close cooperation with the Supervisory Board, always \n\nreacted decisively and consistently and took me\nasures to mitigate the impact of the COVID\n-19 pandemic \nwhile investing into the future of PUMA. Thereby, we laid the foundation for a successful 2021, in which \n\nPUMA will return to growth.\n In the financial year 2020, the Supervisory Board has exercised all \nits duties under the law, statutes and \ncompany rules. The Supervisory Board has dealt extensively with the status and the development of PUMA, \n\nparticularly in view of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, and has regularly advised and supervised the Management \nBoard in i\nts management of the Company.\n In this regard, the Supervisory Board has in its four regular meetings discussed and resolved on the \n\nCompanyÕs business policies, all relevant aspects of corporate development and corporate planning, the \n\nCompanyÕs economic sit\nuation, including its net assets, financial position and results of operations, and all \nkey decisions for the Group. The Management Board has informed the Supervisory Board regularly, \n\ncomprehensively, and in a timely manner in written and verbal form about\n the implementation of all \n!!JEAN\n-FRAN‡OIS PALUS\n CHAIRMAN OF THE\n  \nSUPERVISORY BOARD\n !JEAN\n-FRAN‡OIS PALUS\n CHAIRMAN OF THE\n  \nSUPERVISORY BOARD\n \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! To our Shareholders\n 10 decisions and about all major business transactions. Furthermore, in 2020 one extraordinary meeting of the \nSupervisory Board took place. Urgent matters were decided via circular resolutions using electronic means \nof communication\n. All members participated in drawing up the resolutions. Whenever necessary, \nrepresentatives of the shareholders and employees held separate preliminary discussions prior to the \n\nmeetings.\n  Plenary Supervisory Board\n Attendance at meetings\n (referring to reg\nular and extraordinary \nmeetings)\n Attendance in %\n Jean-Fran“ois Palus\n 5/5\n 100 Thore Ohlsson\n 5/5\n 100 H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer\n 5/5\n 100 Fiona May\n 5/5\n 100 Martin Kıppel\n 5/5\n 100 Bernd Illig\n 5/5\n 100     The Supervisory Board discussed in detail all of the CompanyÕs key business transactions, based on the \nreports by the Management Board and the Committees, and presented its own ideas. The Management \n\nBoard has provided the Supervisory Board with detailed in\nformation on any deviations of the business \n\nperformance from the budgeted figures, both in writing and orally. The Supervisory Board verified these \n\nexplanations using the supporting documents, which were always submitted in appropriate time before the \nmeet\nings. The Supervisory Board was involved in all key decisions at an early stage. In addition, the \nChairman of the Supervisory Board maintained, and continues to maintain, regular verbal or written contact \nwith the CEO and keeps himself informed of all majo\nr developments. Overall, these discussions did not give \nany indication that the Management Board was managing the Group in anything other than a lawful and \n\nproper manner. \n The Supervisory Board members took part, on their own initiative, in the educational\n and training measures \nnecessary for the performance of their duties. The Company supports the Supervisory Board members in \n\ntheir training activities, for example by having the Legal Department regularly review changes in the legal \n\nframework for the Superv\nisory Board and report about them in the meetings. The Supervisory Board \nintensively dealt with the Act Implementing the Second Shareholders\' Rights Directive (ARUG II) introducing \n\nthe legal requirement to approve a compensation system for the members of t\nhe Management Board and \nwith the German Act Concerning Measures Under the Law of Companies, Cooperative Societies, \nAssociations, Foundations and Commonhold Property to Combat the Effects of the COVID\n-19 Pandemic. \n MAIN ADVISORY FOCUS\n In the financial year \n2020, the focus was primarily on the following topics: Audit and approval of the 2019 \nfinancial statements and the non\n-financial report, continuous assessment of the impacts and the handling \nof the COVID\n-19 pandemic, approval of the loan under participatio\nn of the state owned bank Kreditanstalt \nr Wiederaufbau (KfW), later in the year the partial refinancing of the KfW loan, setting the agenda for the \n\nAnnual General Meeting of May 7, 2020, approval of the Management BoardÕs decisions regarding the \nconduct \nof the Annual General Meeting as a virtual shareholdersÕ meeting without the physical presence of \nshareholders or their proxies, ongoing business and sales development, markets and trends, the GroupÕs \n\nfinancial position, business and budget planning for 20\n21 and medium\n-term planning, including \ninvestments, further improvements of the compliance management and the internal control system as well \n\nas material litigation in the Group. \n ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! To our Shareholders\n 11 As every year, the Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board determine\nd the target achievements for \nthe variable remuneration of the Management Board members related to 2019 and decided on the bonus \nfor the members of the Management Board. Upon recommendation of its Personnel Committee the \nSupervisory Board made a decision o\nn target setting for the Management Board compensation for the \nfinancial year 2020.\n CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n The members of the Supervisory Board are required to disclose to its Chair any conflicts of interest without \n\nundue delay. In the past year, no such di\nsclosures were made.\n COMMITTEES\n The Supervisory Board has established three committees to perform its duties: The Personnel Committee, \nthe Audit Committee and the Nominating Committee. The Personnel Committee and the Audit Committee \n\neach comprise two share\nholder representatives and one employee representative. The Nominating \n\nCommittee is composed only of shareholder representatives. The composition of the committees can be \n\nfound in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Supervisory Board re\nceives regular reports \non their work. \n PERSONNEL COMMITTEE\n The Personnel Committee has the task of preparing the conclusion and amendment of employment \n\ncontracts with the members of the Management Board and establishing policies for Human Resources and \n\npersonnel development. It met twice in 2020 and mainly dealt with the compensation system for the \nManagement Board to be proposed to the shareholders for resolution at the Annual General Meeting in \n2021. Furthermore, the discussions focused on proposals for d\netermining the bonus payments for the \nmembers of the Management Board and the definition of the targets for 2020.

It held no meeting in the last financial year. \n CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n As in previous years, the Supervi\nsory Board addressed current developments in the German Corporate \nGovernance Code (GCGC) in the financial year 2020. The GCGC contains essential statutory regulations and \nrecommendations for the management and supervision of listed companies and standards \nfor responsible \ncorporate governance. The corporate governance standards have long been a part of the corporate routine. \nAccordingly, the Supervisory Board also considered the adjustments in the GCGC effective as of March 20, \n2020. Pursuant to Principle 22\n of the GCGC, the Supervisory Board reports on corporate governance in the \nCorporate Governance Statement. With very few exceptions, the Company satisfies the requirements of the \n\nGCGC and explains these system\n-related exceptions in the Statement of Complia\nnce. The Statement of \nCompliance of November 9, 2020 is available to our shareholders at any time on the CompanyÕs website \nunder \nhttps://about.\nPUMA\n.com/en/investor\n-relations/\ncorporate\n-governance\n at STATEMENT OF \nCOMPLIANCE.\n ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADOPTED\n The annual financial statements for PUMA SE prepared by the Management Board in accordance with the \nGerman Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch/HGB), the consolidated financ\nial statements and the \ncombined management report for PUMA SE and the PUMA Group, each for the financial year 2020, \nprepared in accordance with Section 315a HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS) have been audited by the\n statutory auditors, Deloitte GmbH \nWirtschaftsprfungsgesellschaft, Munich, who were appointed at the Annual General Meeting on May 7, \n\n2020 and commissioned by the Supervisory Board to audit the annual financial statements and the \n\nconsolidated financial st\natements and have been given an unqualified auditorÕs opinion.\n In their report, the statutory auditors conclude that PUMAÕs institutionalized risk management system, in \naccordance with Section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz/AktG), \nis capable of \ndetecting at an early stage and countering any developments that might jeopardize the continuity of the \nCompany as a going concern. The Supervisory Board has been updated by the Management Board regularly \n\non all relevant risks in this regard,\n in particular its assessments of market and procurement risks, financial \nrisks (including currency risks as well as risks due to the COVID\n-19 pandemic) and organizational risks.\n The accounting records, the audit reports from the statutory auditors and the\n Management BoardÕs and \nSupervisory BoardÕs recommendation on the appropriation of net profit were made available to all \n\nmembers of the Supervisory Board in a timely manner. At the meeting of the Audit Committee on February \n\n23, 2021 and at the subsequent S\nupervisory Board meeting held on the same day, the statutory auditors \nreported on the key results of their audit and discussed them in detail with the Management Board and the \n\nmembers of the Supervisory Board. No discrepancies were detected. \n \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! To our Shareholders\n 13 The Superviso\nry Board reviewed in detail the annual financial statements, the combined management \nreport for PUMA SE and the PUMA Group, the Management BoardÕs and the Supervisory BoardÕs \nrecommendation on the appropriation of net profit and the consolidated financial \nstatements and raised no \nobjections. In accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board agreed \n\nwith the results of the audit of both statements and approved the annual financial statements of PUMA SE \n\nand the consolidated fi\nnancial statements for the financial year 2020. The 2020 annual financial statements \nhave thus been adopted. \n The Management Board and the Supervisory Board resolved to propose to the Annual General Meeting a \ndistribution of a dividend of \n! 0.16 per divide\nnd entitled share to the shareholders for the financial year \n2020. In this context, the liquidity situation of the Company, the financing and the effects on the capital \nmarket were discussed. The payout is conditional to an overall sound macroeconomic envi\nronment. A total \namount of around \n! 23.9 million will be paid out in dividends from PUMA SEÕs retained earnings. The \nremaining retained earnings of around \n! 366.5 million will be carried forward. \n In its meeting on February 23, 2021, the Supervisory Board \nwas presented the state of data collection for \nthe non\n-financial report in accordance with ¤¤ 315c in conjunction with ¤¤ 289c to 289e of the German \nCommercial Code (HGB). As soon as the non\n-financial report is finalised, it will be submitted to the \nSuperv\nisory Board for approval and will be published on the website of the Company by April 30, 2021. \n THANKS\n We would like to express our gratitude and recognition to the Management Board, the management teams \nat the Group companies, the Works Council and all o\nur employees for their hard work and their outstanding \ncooperation in 2020. \n Herzogenaurach, February 23, 2021 \n On behalf of the Supervisory Board\n  Jean-Fran“ois Palus\n Chairman\n  \n  Annual Report\n 2020     !

Our People\n 15 PUMA FAMILY\n Over \nthe pa\nst \nfew \nyears\n, \nour main strategic priorities have been\n to put our\n employee\ns \nfirst,\n continue our\n digital transformation\n, \nand build an agile learning \norganization. This foundation supported us \nas we tackled \nthe \nmain challenges of 2020. During th\nis year \nmarked by the pandemic\n, \nour priority more than ever \nwas \nto \nkeep our PUMA family safe, informed\n, \nand engaged.\n Our employees are our most important asset. Giving prompt and accurate information about the pandemic \nand its\n immediate\n effects\n on their day\n-to-day routin\ne was essential. During the \nperiod \nwhen most markets \nwere in lockdown and nearly all employees were \nbeing \nasked to work from home, our existing digital \ninfrastructure a\nnd our flexible work schedules and\n mobile working\n policies \nhelp\ned us to quickly adjust \nto \nthe new \nwork \nrequirements and even expedited our digital transformation. This enabled us to adapt to\n the \nnew business requirements and stay connected with our employees while \nthey were \nworking from other \nlocations. During the pandemic\n, \nour digital learning platform was leveraged to support our employees in \nthe areas \nof wellbeing, \nresilience and\n m\nindfulne\nss, \nand professional development. \n All those measures contributed to high employee engagement and \nhelp\ned the PUMA family \nto master \nthis \nchallenging year\n; \nwe feel well equipped to continue\n on our path to greater growth. \n DIGITILIZATION\n In 2020\n, \nwe \ngreat\nly accelerated the digitalization of our business processes, making them even simpler and \nfaster around the world. \nSince 2017, w\ne have been using ÒWorkdayÓ as our main software solution for \nnearly all HR processes. \nThis\n gives employees and managers ac\ncess to all\n the\n processes and tools \nrequired \nto carry out everyday personnel management tasks. Managers also have access to user\n-friendly \ndashboards\n that\n show them information and give them data\n-driven insights, which are necessary for their \nplanning and p\nersonnel management. The analysis of our global data, which is centrally available, gives us \na solid basis for strategic decisions and measurable results. \nUsing Microsoft Teams globally, we were well \nprepared for the challenges that global contact and trav\nel restrictions presented and able to continue \nworking together\n smoothly.\n COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n 2020 was also a challenging year for \ncommunity \nengagement. Due to local regulations \nmandating fewer\n social contacts a\nnd social distancing\n, \nwe often had to change\n the way we engage with our local \ncommunities through projects all around the world and find new ways of engaging. One example\n of our \nactivities\n was the ÒBig SmileÓ\n project\n. \nPUMA Ukraine donate\nd \nitems to orphanages for the\n childrenÕs\n first \nday of school. P\nUMA employees in Hong Kong provided laptops to underprivileged children to support their \nhome\n-schooling activities. In Germany\n, \nemployees packed food pa\nrcel\ns c\nontain\ning special treats \nsuch as\n cookies, chocolate\n, \nand special\nty coffee to distribute to local food banks\n, \nwhich \nthen \nhanded them out to \npeople in need. \n Our goal was to reach a total number of hours spent on community engagement equal to our \nannual \naverage FTE (\nfull\n-t\nime \nequivalent). We encouraged all our employees ar\nound the world to participate and \nrecord projects and employee engagement on an online platform. In total, initiatives led by our subsidiaries \non five\n continents contributed a total of \n19,023 hours \n(2,376 \nfor PUMA SE) of community engagement. \nProjects rang\ned from protecting the environment\n and promoting health and fitness\n to fighting \ndiscrimination \nand supporting \nthe \neducation o\nf \nchildren in need. Often these projects were carried out\n in \ncooperation with local non\n-profit organizations. Considering that the \nnumber of FTEs in 2020 was \n13,016 (919 for PUMA SE), we reached our target.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

Our People\n 17 CULTURE The PUMA working culture is unique and driven by our employees. In the year of the pandemic, our culture \nclearly\n helped us to take \nfast\n decisions, be agile\n, \nand hav\ne \nthe resilience and trust in \none another to find \nnew solutions and ways of working. A key f\nactor is the diversity of our teams and the ongoing effort\n to \nensure that \ncommunicat\nion \nwith\n all of our employees\n is transparent and swift\n. \nDIVERSITY &amp; EQUALITY\n Diversity and equality were important topics \naround the world \nthis year after scenes of police \nbrutality in \nthe United States kicked off widespread protests in many countries. As a company with offices all across \nthe globe and employees of many \ndifferent \nnationalities and backgrounds\n, it \nwas important for us to \nease our employeesÕ\n concerns and reite\nrate \nour strong belie\nf \nthat diversity makes us better. Diversity and \nequality are the most important ingredients for the growth of our brand. Diverse teams with different \n\nskillsets and backgrounds are a crucial resource when it comes to creative thinking, decision\n-making\n, \nand driving innovation forward. \n We have made this belief in diversity and inclusion a part of PUMAÕs working culture and we encourage all \n\nof our employees to show their own personality. One of our values as an employer sums this up as: ÒBe \n\nYou!Ó. This also mea\nns that a fair work environment and equal opportunities for all PUMA employees, \n\nregardless of their gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, age\n, \nor sexual orientation, have been a \ncornerstone of our policy for many decades. These commitments \nare also reiterated in our PUMA Code of \nEthics (2005) and \nin our Diversity Charter (2010).  \n In 2020, we \nconducted\n a global survey\n, \nrolled out locally\n, \nto understand how our employees feel about \nequality at PUMA. We invited our employees \nto engage i\nn open \ndialog \non this topic \nwith the senior \nmanagement at all PUMA locations all over the world. We also set up the Employee Resource Group PUMA \n\nNorth America and similar informal advisory committees elsewhere to make sure our employees know that \n\nwe are listening\n to their concerns regarding diversity and equality. We also raised awareness \nof this topic \non our internal communication channels and invited employees to \ntalk \nopenly about racism, discrimination \nand equality\n, \nand how it impacts their lives.\n Moreover, we \norganized additional training sessions o\nn \ndiversity and equality. For our employees\n, \nwe run \nonline training course campaigns \nÐ \nthrough LinkedIn Learning and Good Habitz\n, for example\n Ð \nand used \nvirtual learning nuggets to provide further perspectives on the\n topic. Furthermore, we emphasized diversity \nand equality as part of our management training programs ILP and Speed Up.\n To show that we welcome people of all sexual orientations at PUMA, the front of our PUMA Brand Center lit \nup in the colors of the rainbo\nw during Pride Month. \nPlus\n, a live DJ \nset was streamed from our PUMA Bridge \nfor a virtual Pride event in Nuremberg\n in cooperation with CSD\n N\nuremberg\n. \nOur employees also engaged in \nseveral \nactivities\n together with CSD N\nuremberg \nwhich were possible\n given the\n local safety measures. \n   \nPUMA \nwel\ncomes all genders\n and constant\nly strives\n to be an attractive place for people of all genders\n to \nwork\n. In 2020, we continued to see a well\n-balanced gender distribution across all locations. The male\n-to-female ratio \nwas \n50% \nto \n50%.  \nWe continued to work on extending this gender balance to all management levels and rais\ning\n the proportion \nof women in leadership positions. In order to empower women, we offer specific training and access to \ninspirational networks. We believe tha\nt the interaction with experienced female executives will encourage \n\nour female employees to aim for leadership positions at PUMA. In 2020, \n43% of management positions \nacross the group were held by \nwomen.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Our People\n 18   !!T.01\n PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN IN MANAG\nEMENT\n POSITIONS \n(in \n%) We have already reached our target to have at least 30% \nfemale representation\n on the Supervisory Board \nand 20% on the Management Board. We are on track to reach our ambitious targets to have 30% \nfemale \nrepresentation\n at the first management level below the\n Management Board and 40% \nfemale representation\n at the second management level below the Management Board, \nin each case by\n October 2021.\n WELLBEING\n At PUMA, fostering the wellbeing of our people is a top priority\n. Therefore, we are dedicated to constantly \nimproving the health and wellbeing of our employees by offering a wide range of services and benefits. The \nwellbeing approach\n was started at our headquarters in Herzogenaurach. It has now been embraced by all \nPUMA subsidiaries around the world and has been \nadapted to local needs and regulations. \nThis topic has \nnever been more important than during the COVID\n-19 pandemic of 2020.\n Our wellbeing approach focuses on four aspects: Flex, Social, Finance\n, \nand Athlete.\n As a sports brand, we \nfocus on giving our employ\nees as many options as possible to live their passion for sports. Therefore, we \noffer different training courses such as yoga, jumping fitness\n, and\n body toning. Besides our huge variety of \ncourses, we provide free gym access, sports courts for football, ba\nsketball, \nand tennis\n, \nas well as beach \nvolleyball. \nA \nmajor highlight \nof 2020 was the opening of our new tennis court at the PUMA \nheadquarters in \nHerzogenaurach. We also introduced our\n Room of Silence\n, which can be used for meditation, prayer\n, \nor just \nto find a calm minute.\n During much of the pandemic, it was no longer possible to h\nold\n wellbeing events, including training \ncourses. Sports facilities also had to be closed in many countries. In order to support our people while \nworking from home, we converted our initiatives into digital offerings. We did this by p\nlac\ning an extended \nfocus on our 360\n-degree wellbeing approach, offering support in the area\ns \nof sports, resilience, nutrition\n, \nand creative \nchildcare \nsolutions. W\ne created\n the PUMA Home A\ncademy, a global platform which hosted the \ncategories Wellbeing, Learning\n, \nand Engage. \nBesides\n daily information, we offered online sports and yoga \nsessions, daily nutrition and recipe ideas\n, \nas well as activities with kids for parents who work at home.

The corona \npandemic was handled\n directly\n by our\n top\n management\n from the start. In frequent update calls,\n our CEO \nand our Global Director People &amp; Organization directly addressed our PUMA community \nglobally\n by providing new informati\non on both the business situation and health\n and safety measures. From \nearly on we implemented a new strict hygiene and safety concept,\n which complied\n with\n all\n applicable\n health \nand safety regulations, i.e. distancing rules, installing hand\n-sanitizer dispe\nnsers and a requirement to wear \nmasks. We are constantly reviewing our hygiene and safety measures\n and are\n adjusting them to the\n present \ncircumstances. This included\n buying protective\n gloves and masks,\n as well as rapid tests\n when they \nbecame\n available. Thi\ns way we\n kept the risk of infection to an absolute minimum.\n  \nWe set ourselves the goal o\nf \nconsistently reduc\ning\n the average injury rate every year. In 2020, our goal was \nto stay below an injury rate of \n0.50\n according to the Occupational Safety and Health A\ndministration (OSHA). \nAs well as c\nonducting safety\n-related training courses \nat all our locations, we also offer online training \nprograms to prepare employees for potential emergency situations and thus reduce the number of \n\naccidents. Last year, we conducte\nd a total of \n21,143 \nhours of safety training. Over the past year, \n6,482\n employees \nwere\n trained in fire safety and \n5,240\n in first aid. The overall number of safety training hours \nincreased\n by 35% compared to the previous year, demonstrating PUMAÕs continued\n focus on this issue.\n On a global scale, only \n51 \noccupational accidents which required work to be stopped were recorded in 2020. \nThis is a decline of \n11% \ncompared\n to the previous year and continues the positive trend seen in recent \nyears. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), this \nequates\n to an injury rate \nof \n0.35\n compared to 0\n.37 in 2019, meaning we improved our performance. The (O\nSHA) injury rate for PUMA \nSE stood at \n0.13\n and was at 0.22 in the previous year.\n A further indicator of employee engagement and the health of our workforce is the rate of absence due to \nsickness, which was \n1.68\n% \nin 20\n20.

Our People\n 21  FEEDBACK\n Feedback is an essential part of our PUMA culture and feedback from inside and outside \nenables us to\n constantly improve. In 2020, the feedback function in Workday was extended \nto include\n a new feature \n- \nthe\n feedback certificates \n- \nwhere employees can give \none another \nfeedback \nquickly\n and eas\nily. This is another \ninitiative to foster an open feedback culture which supports regular conversations and learning \nopportunities \nfor\n employees and managers alike. \nDurin\ng \nthe year, pulse surveys were \nalso conducted in \norder\n to quickly \nobtain\n employee feedback on current topics and thereby gain valuable insights from our \nemployees. In addition, regular benchmark\ning\n is \ncarried out\n with the industry and this is reflected\n, \nfor example\n, \nin our Top Employer certification, our \nGreat Place to Work \naward,\n and the audit berufundfamilie.\n AWARDS\n During 2020\n, \nPUMA received several \nawards\n which\n recogniz\ne \nour ongoing effort\ns \nto create a diverse, \ninclusive\n, \nand equal workforce\n. \nWe are pro\nud to have\n been recognized by the Financial Times for the second year in \na row \nin its\n Ò\nDiversity\n LeadersÓ\n ranking \nfor Europe. PUMA North America was also listed as\n one of the\n ÒBest Employers for \nDiversityÓ in 2020 among 500 companies across all industries that demonstrate a strong commitment to \ndiversity and inclusion. As part of our continued efforts to further develop PUMAÕs working culture\n, \nwe \nreceived the \nÒTop Employer\nÓ award \nfor\n the second consecutive year\n in Europe\n and also proudly received \nthis award for the first time in South Africa. \nUnderlin\ning\n our global efforts, we also received the \nÒGreat \nPlace to Work\nÓ \naward \nfor India and Argentina. \n! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Our People\n 22 PERSONAL JOURNEY\n As a company\n, we can only reach our goals \nif we attract, \nrecruit,\n and retain talent for PUMA. Competing for \nthe best suitable talent on the market, our intention is to raise awareness of PUMA as an employer of \nchoice which offers challenging roles, while providing pro\nfessional talent management and unique \ndevelopment opportunities. \n RECRUITING\n It is crucial that we are perceived as \nan employer of choice and attract external candidates who want to join \nthe unique PUMA working culture. In order to connect with these \npotential candidates, we use digital \nplatforms and social media for our target group\n-specific, individual recruiting measures, as well as our \ncareer website. Last year\n, \nwe optimized the candidate journey in our ATS Applicant Tracking System \n(Workday) to ev\nen better meet \nthe\n needs o\nf \nexternal and internal applicants. At the same time, we \nreconsidered our global recruitment standards, aligned and communicated with our P&amp;O colleagues across \n\nall markets. Extensive networks of qualified applicants and up\n-to-date\n candidate pools help us to quickly fill \nvacancies. \n TALENT\n MAN\nAGEMENT\n We believe that our employees are the driver of their personal career journey. With an integrated talent \nmanagement approach, we foster a feedback and results\n-driven culture at PUMA and\n a self\n-driven learning \nattitude. We \nregularly \nevaluate all employees, set up individual development plans\n, \nand identify the right \npeople to prepare them \nto driv\ne \nPUMA\nÕs future\n. \nWe conduct talent conferences globally to assess the entire PUMA workforce, including all levels of \nmanagement. Employees are evaluated on criteria such as individual performance and competencies, \n\npotential, ambition, and mobility. The targeted analysis of\n our employeesÕ profiles allows us to match \ninternal talent with upcoming vacancies. This helps us to find potential successors within the company and \n\nto foresee and address \nour organizationÕs\n future competency needs. Last year\n, \nwe were able to fill most o\nf our key positions worldwide through internal promotions or horizontal transfers.\n DEVELOPMENT\n Our employeesÕ\n ongoing professional and personal development also ensures that our workforce has the \nnecessary expertise \nboth \nto guarantee internal growth \nand to drive the business. Therefore, we offer a wide \nrange of training courses and workshops, both online and offline, standardized or specially tailored to \n\nindividual needs.\n Shifting our focus to a self\n-driven learning culture\n, \nwe provide a state\n-of-the\n-art learning infrastructure \nintegrated in\nto the \nWorkday \nHuman Capital Management \nsystem for internal and external training courses. \nWith the launch of LinkedIn Learning and Good Habitz\n, \nmore than 16,500 different online training courses \nare available for persona\nl and professional development\n across a wide variety of learning categories\n. In \n2020, we \ncontinued to adapt\n our training offer\ning\ns to the challenges resulting from the increased \namount of \ntime \nspent\n working from home. Learning content such as mental wellbe\ning, resilience, mindfulness\n, \nand emotional stability\n, which\n was also promoted t\nhrough \nHome \nAcademy\n, \nhelps us as \nan employer to provide \nour employees worldwide with the best possible support during the pandemic. Due to contact restrictions, \nface\n-to-face tr\naining was largely replaced by virtual concepts \nto enable us\n to continue to provide th\nis training. In 2020, \n17,372\n employees\n worldwide participated in training courses and workshops over a total \nof \n122,256\n hours. \n Our clear \ngoal is to build an agile \nlearning organization. To kick\n-start this\n, \nwe \ncontinued to drive our agile \ncoach program where PUMA employees from all departments are trained in agile \nways of working. \n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Our People\n 23 First\n, \nbest practices were generated in our business and resonated well with external \nand internal project \nparticipants.

To reach our goals\n, \nwe rely on \nresilient managers who can navigate through the crisis and master the new complex challenges the \npandemic presents. The set of competencies we defined, which are\n necessary to successfully lead a team in \nan increasingly complex and volatile work environment\n, \nprepared our leaders well for the challenges faced \nthrough the pandemic.\n PUMA leaders receive inten\nsive training and coaching, including interactive \nlearning, roleplay simulations and best practice learning, as well as joint projects. \nParticular point\ns \nof focus \ninclude\n mindful leadership, agile working methods\n, \nand diversity\n and inclusion.\n The program c\nonsists of \ndifferent modules, providing leaders with the opportunity to apply the newly acquired knowledge in between \n\nseminars.\n To ensure\n seamless \nleadership development\n, \nmost courses in 2020 were\n digital and participants\n connected with their trainers and \npeers t\nhrough MS Teams. \n   SPEED UP\n / \nSPEED U\nP2 Accelerating \nour employeesÕ\n progress is essential for organizational success. Driving that ambition, two \nselective development programs, Speed Up and Speed Up2\n, \nare designed to unlock the potential of our \ntalent. To prepare them for the next steps in their career, we provide an inte\nnse curriculum, including \ncross\n-functional projects and tasks, coaching, mentoring, job swaps\n, and\n targeted training courses. \nParticipants also benefit from exposure to top management and establish strong networks globally. Due to \n\nthe current \nsituation,\n we developed a virtual kick\n-off module for the third global \ncohort\n, \nwhich we identified \nin 2020\n, \nand will start\n in 2021. \n FUTURE\n TALENTS\n Identifying talent at a very early stage is key to foster\ning\n the next generation of employees \nwho\n will \ncontribute to PUMA\nÕs future success. A varied range of initiatives at universities, both locally and \ninternationally, gives us the opportunity to approach potential employees and identify suitable candidates. \n\nWe offer a lot of options within an international working environ\nment, creating the perfect conditions for \npeople starting their careers. In 2020, 14 dual\n-program students and trainees joined the PUMA \nheadquarters in Herzogenaurach. In total, PUMA had 43 apprentices and dual\n-program students by the end \nof 2020, majoring\n in a range of subjects from International Business to IT.

Before the \nCOVID\n-19 crisis, we saw the \ninterest of our customers, investors, employees\n, \nand other stakeholders in our \nsustainability programs \nincrease significantly\n. Despite the pandemic, t\nhis trend continued and \neven intensified during 2020\n, as we \nlaunched our first sustainability\n-focused lighthouse collections in partnership with First Mile and Central \nSt. Martins Londo\nn. 2020 clearly\n was\n dominated by the pandemic. We \nhad started the year with fresh momentum when the virus \nhit \nour \nsourcing \nand sales market. Our \nsourcing team worked hard to shift production orders from \none \ncountry \nto \nan\nother\n while \nassisting \nthe affected vendors to ensure they \nwere \nkept afloat\n financially\n and workersÕ health was protected\n. \n! !ANNE\n-LAURE DESCOURS\n CHIEF SOURCING\n OFFICER (CSO)\n \nAnnual Report \n2020     \n! Sustainability\n 26 Then the virus spread globally and lockdown\ns \nin almost all sales markets \nbrought \nour business \nto a halt \nin April and May. \nIn an effort to ensure \nPUMA\nÕs financial stab\nility, we\n worked very closely with our \nmanufacturers \nand customers to delay orders, extend payment terms\n and react flexibl\ny \nto the challenging \nbusiness environment. \n Our \nestablished \nPUMA Vendor \nFi\nnance \nProgram, which is linked to our suppliers\nÕ sustainability \nperformance\n, pro\nved very valuable during this time and we saw the amount of financed volume more than \ndouble \non previous years.\n To protect our business partners and their hundreds of thousands\n of workers\n, \nwe also \nrefrained from \ncancel\ning\n orders. During all of \n2020, \nwe canceled less than \n1 %\n of our orders and in the rare cases where \nwe \nhad to \ncancel orders\n, \nwe \ncovered \nthe \ncosts \nfor materials and other expenses\n our suppliers\n had incurred\n. \nAs our \nPeople and Organization team was protecting our own staff \nwith \nstrict hygiene measures, \nan extended \nwork\n-from\n-home \npolic\ny, \nand flexitime,\n our \nsustainability team worked with other brands and our \nsuppliers to ensure \nour manufacturing partners also\n applied \neffective hygiene measures\n. We closely \nmonitored the number of factories which had to temporarily shut down production and any potential \nimplications for the workers due to the closures\n. \nHaving the ability to articulate oneÕs needs and concerns is a key tenet of human rights. Providing workers \nwith avenues to advocate for themselves is a top priority for PUMA as part of our commitment to \nbeing a \nfair\n market leader. In addition to the\n inter\nnal PUMA hotline system, in 2020 we \ncontinued to \npromote\n third\n-party grievance platforms such as \nMicroBenefit\ns \nand Amader Kotha. \nBy December 2020, our worker \nhotlines counted a record number of \n1,122 \ncases and we \nsucceeded in solv\ning\n almost all of them\n. \nThroughout the year, we have kept an open dialogue with relevant stakeholders including governments, \n\ninternational organisations and other interested parties, to ensure that our long\n-standing human rights due \ndiligence mechanisms are updated, communicated and observed, as we are committed to comply with any \n\nlatest regulations\n. \nOur factory level auditing and capability building programs and envir\nonmental protection programs were \naffected by travel restrictions. Nevertheless, we continued our efforts where possible and managed to \nrecord 490 factory audits, \n127 facility level Higg Index Environmental Assessments and 125 wastewater \ntests.\n We finished\n the year by issuing green finance tools for PUMA, by hitting our 2025 target of using 100% more \nsustainable cotton \nfabrics\n already in 2020 and by training our designers on the principles of circularity.\n We look forward to overcoming the \nCOVID\n-19 crisis in 2021 and are determined to accelerate our \nsustainability journey\n f\nor our customers, employees, suppliers, investors\n, \nand the wider PUMA family. \nWe believ\ne we are stronger together\n and responsible\n business conduct \nis \nnot only an ethical imperative \nbut \nalso\n makes perfect business sen\nse. \n\n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! Sustainability\n 27 PUMA\nÕS 10FOR25 SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY\n Our 10FOR25 sustainability strategy \nis an evolution of\n our previous sustainability strategy which was buil\nt \non creating \nmaximum positive impact\n. Following an extensive \nmateriality analysis process and stakeholder \ndialog\nue\n, we decided to \nmerge our \nHuman \nRights and \nSocial \nCompliance\n categories\n, \nupgrade our \nMaterial \ntargets to \nProduct targets and add the new target categories of\n Cir\ncularity, Plastics and the Oceans,\n Fair \nWages\n, \nand Biodiversity.\n In order to keep the \nnumber of target areas manageable, we removed \nStakeholder \nDialog\nue\n, Environmental \nProfit and \nLoss (EP&amp;L) \naccounting\n, \nand Corporate \nGovernance from our\n target \nmatrix.\n S\ntakeholder \nDialog\nue \nand EP&amp;L \nwill be continued as\n important\n tools to\n measure and finetune\n our \nsustainability \ntargets\n. \nBecause \ncorporate \ngovernance \nis \ngrowing\n in importance\n, it \nwill be reported \nseparately \nin future.\n  \nWith our new 10FOR25 sustainability strate\ngy we continue our path to fully integrate sustainability into all \nour core business functions. \nSustainability targets \nare \nincluded in the \nbonus \narrangements\n of every \nmember of our \nglobal \nLeadership team\n, from the CEO to the team heads\n. \nAfter working \nhard \non our sustainability performance\n in the background rather than center stage\n, we \ndecided to communicate our sustainability efforts \nmore actively \nin \nthe \nfuture and\n have \nadded this \nnew focus \nto the \nstrategic priorities for PUMA.\n STAKEHOLDER DIALOG\nUE \nDuring 2020 we continued our active stakeholder dialogue, although in a different way.\n Because a\nll sustainability\n-related\n conferences and meeting\ns in \nour industry had to be \nconducted \nvirtual\nly, w\ne also held \nour \nRegional \nSupplie\nr and \nStakeholder \nRound Table \nMeetings \nin the form of \nvirtual event\ns. As we \nwere \ndeeply involved in\n global \nindustry\n-level\n stakeholder meetings about s\nocial \ncompliance, \nclimate \nchange, \nand chemicals, we decided to \npostpone \nour own global stakeholder meeting \nschedu\nled for \n2020. This freed up \nresources for our \ntop management\n to participate in the \nannual \nevent of the UN\n-lead Fashion \nIndustry \nCharter for Climate Action\n (\nattended by our \nCEO), and the Industry Summit \non Social \nCompliance \n(attended \nby our \nCSO)\n. Other \nPUMA\n business\n leaders participated in the Copenhagen Fashion Summit\n. \nIn addition, we \ntrained our design and product teams on the concept of circularity with the help of the expert organization \nCircle Economy. \n  \nWe also engaged in \nregional\n one-on-one consultation\ns \nwith key organi\nzation\ns \nincluding \nBetter Work \nVietnam, Bangladesh and Indonesia, the Fair Labor Association, the Fair \nWage Network\n, \nthe\n International \nOrgani\nzation for Migration, other brands\n, \nand critical \nsuppliers\n to review our workplan \non human \nrights, \nhealth\n, safety\n, \nand fair \nincome\n for 2025\n.

The \nobservance\n of \nhuman \nrights \nwas\n part of our first Code of Conduct developed \nin 1993 \nand has guided our business ethics ever \nsince. In 2019\n, \nwe established a Responsible Purchasing Policy and \na related \ntraining program to ensure our sourcing practices are aligned with our Code of Conduct. \nIn 2020\n, \nwe focused on keeping our suppliers in business and safeguard\ning\n workers\nÕ \nhealth, employment\n, \nand income through several measures including:\n 1. \nOrder\n and Production Management\n ¥!Minimizing order cancellations; 0.35% of orders were canceled in 2020 \n ¥!The canceled orders were not yet in production, we compensated for raw material liabilities\n ¥!Agreeing on order delays with our customers during the difficult l\nockdown period\n ¥!Extending our production lead times by 19% on average to facilitate more flexibility along the supply \nchain\n  2. \nFinancing \nand Payments\n ¥!Expanding our PUMA Vendor Financing Program with an increase in \nsupplier participation \nfrom 21% in \n2019 to 30% in 2020.\n Average usage of the program in 2019 was 10% (\nUSD \n196m) of the invoice volume \nwith eligible vendors, which increased to 31% in 2020 (\nUSD\n 587m)\n ¥!Extending payment terms\n for \nour suppliers and\n our customers\n ¥!Paying all orders in full\n and on time\n ¥!No late\n-delivery\n penalties\n  3. \nGuidance \nand Best\n-Practice\ns \nSharing\n Our \nSustainability team held three \nvirtual meetings with our suppliers to share \nbest\n practices and \nguidelines on social distancing\n, hygiene measures\n, \nand on\n-time and full payment to workers.\n Close to 700 \npeople from \nmore than 300 factories attended each session.\n !!T.02\n ORDER CANCELLATIONS DUE TO COVID\n-19 Cancellations (%)\n FTW APP ACC Total\n Full Year 2020\n 0.43%\n 0.34\n% 0.10\n% 0.35\n%       In previous years\n, \nwe had conducted human rights risk assessments at \nthe c\norporate and\n the\n s\nupply \nchain \nlevel \nand communicated the results in our 2016 and 2017 Annual Reports. The most\n salient\n risk\ns \nto human \nrights are forced\n or \nbonded labor in our supply chain and, at the farm level, child labor.\n It has been the long\n-standing practice of PUMA to continuously and rigorously monitor our supply chain and \nconduct human rights due diligence on all of our\n suppliers globally, including those in major production \nhubs such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. When we became aware of the report by the Australian \nStrategic Policy Institute (ASPI), we appreciated it as an opportunity to further review our supply ch\nain. As a \nresult of the assessments, we could find no evidence supporting the allegations\n. \n! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! Sustainability\n 37 Due to the COVID\n-19 pandemic, we postponed our activities to eliminate recruitment fees in Taiwan to 2021. \n Our Community Engagement Program also has been affected severely by the pandemic. Nevertheless, the \nefforts of our employees \nto create positive impact locally by supporting social, health, and environmental \ncauses continued where possible and we were able to donate 19,000 community hours in 2020.\n SOCIAL COMPLIANCE \nCompliance with our Vendor Code of Conduct remains the foundation\n of our human rights due diligence \nprocess. Since 1999, all direct PUMA suppliers have been frequently audited for compliance with ILO Core \nLabor Standards, internationally accepted Health and Safety provisions, and basic environmental \n\nstandards. In recent\n years, we have also included our most relevant material and component suppliers in \nour audit program.\n Each year, we collect between 300 and 500 audit or assessment reports issued by PUMAÕs Compliance \n\nteam, the ILO Better Work Program, our industry peers, \nor independent experts accredited by the Social \nand Labor Convergence Program (SLCP).\n Despite travel restrictions and partial lockdowns, in 2020 we were able to collect 490 audit reports from 406 \n\nsuppliers. Four percent of our T1 suppliers failed to meet o\nur requirements. If the company in question was \nan active PUMA supplier, we worked together to improve the situation. A pass grade was awarded to 89% of \ncompanies subjected to a second audit. Seven factories did not manage to sufficiently improve their \nperformance and were consequently removed from our active supplier factory base. Applicants that failed \ntheir first audits were not taken on as suppliers.\n Our Social and Labor Compliance Program has been accredited by the Fair Labor Association since 2007 \n\nand was re\n-accredited most recently in 2019.\n To avoid duplication and prevent auditing fatigue, in 2020 we increased the percentage of shared \nassessments to 54%, from 43% in 2019. As part of our commitment to the Industry Summit and the Social \nand Labor Convergence Program, we will further increase our adoption of SLCP\n-based assessments to at \nleast 50% in 2022. We believe that SLCP is an ideal tool for building long\n-term relationships with suppliers \nand supporting them to own their social and labor \ndata.\n We employ a team of compliance experts spread across all \nour \nmajor sourcing regions. They regularly visit \nand audit our core manufacturing partners. We also \nwork with \nexternal compliance auditors and with the \nInternational Labor Organization\nÕs \nBetter\n Work Program\n. \nEach PUMA supplier factory has to undergo \none mandatory compliance audit \nper year \nand a\nll issues identified need to\n be remedied as part of a corrective\n-action plan.\n ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! Sustainability\n 38 !!T.03 AUDIT RESULTS 2018\n-2020 The extensive nature of the SLCP verified data set has helped to identify\n additional\n issues for remediation, \nwhich explain\ns why\n the number of factories with A and B+ \ngrades\n decreased\n. We noticed improvement\ns \nin \noccupational \nhealth and \nsafety\n, \nrisk management and transparency\n. R\neducing overtime and increasing \nsocial security coverage remains a focus of our efforts.\n Beyond auditing, we track social key performance indicators such as average payments vs. minimum wage \npayments, overtime hours or c\noverage by collective bargaining agreements. Those data are discussed \nunder the Fair Wages target.\n We operate multiple worker voice channels. If workers are not satisfied with the responses offered by \n\nfactories via their respective internal grievance syste\nm, we encourage the use of the PUMA Hotline to raise \ncomplaints or request consultations. Phone numbers and email addresses for this hotline are published on \n\nour Code of Conduct posters displayed at every factory globally. We also use WeChat, Zalo, Faceboo\nk, and \nother social media to connect with workers and have established more formalized compliance and human \n\nresources apps at selected core suppliers.\n In 2020, a total of 101 complaint issues were raised to PUMAÕs feedback system across six countries, 44% \n\nmore than during the previous year. Our team resolved 99% of them. Also, we received 1,021 feedback \nrequests from workers through the MicroBenefits Program in China and Vietnam and the Amader Kotha \nHelpline in Bangladesh. Initially established as a project\n by the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety \nfollowing the Rana Plaza tragedy, the hotline provides a safe, timely, and effective communication channel \n\nfor the purpose of identifying and resolving safety and other concerns of workers of PUMAÕs Bangladesh \n\nsuppliers. Last year, workers raised 703 issues concerning safety, compensation, abuse, etc., a 123% \n\nincrease year\n-over\n-year. Calls related to COVID\n-19 represented almost half of the total calls received \nbetween March and July 2020. Using the app\n-based tec\nhnology provided by MicroBenefits in China and \nVietnam, we covered more than 30,000 workers from 20 core suppliers. In 2020, we received and resolved \n\n318 grievances or queries from those apps.\n We also received\n five\n third\n-party complaints from external orga\nnizations related to PUMA\nÕs manufacturing \npartners. The\ny focused on freedom of association, fair compensation\n, \nand discrimination. \nFour complaints \nwere \nresolved by year end\n, one is still under follow\n-up due to\n the fact that\n we received \nit late in the \nyear\n. \n!

We immediately engaged \nwith the supplier and the Better Work Bangladesh team. Due to the complexity of the case, it took \nmonths to evaluate the nature of th\ne process and to investigate whether labor laws were being \nfollowed.

A follow\n-up assessment to measure remediation progress was conducted in 2019; hours of work and \ncompensation violations were identified. The piece\n-rate system in place at the factory discouraged \nworkers from taking sick leave or breaks \nduring the workday, putting pregnant workers and new \nmothers at disproportionate risk. Workers earned an average net monthly wage of 74% of the Global \nLiving Wage CoalitionÕs living wage estimate. Further, the average workerÕs compensation for \novertime con\nstituted 60% of their total wages. PUMA and the factory worked together to identify the \n\nroot causes of the violations related to hours of work and compensation. On average, the workersÕ \n\nnet monthly wage increased by 43% between 2016 and 2019. By 2019, the \naverage net wage for \nworkers had increased to 4.7 million VND (roughly USD202) and overtime wages had decreased to \n\n1.6 million VND (roughly USD71).

For recycling and recycled PU, we have entered in\nto a research project with a large chemical company and \naim to announce our first pilot in 2021.\n To demonstrate our responsibility as a producer and to secure options for more circular material streams \nin the future, we also have set the target to offer takeback schemes in\n all our major markets by 2025\n.

We aim to pilot the first \ntakeback\n options in 2021, \ncomplementing our existing \ntakeback\n pilot scheme in Hong Kong.\n At the same time, we partnered with Circle Economy and held a virtual workshop on the definition and \n\nconcept of a circular economy \nand circular product design\n for our designers, product line managers, \ndevelopers, and sourcing te\nams\n. The training addressed the challenges and opportunities in our industry to \nenhance the cyclability of our products, for example\n, \nby designing for longevity, easy disassembly\n, modularity\n, \netc. \n To communicate our use of recycled material\ns, we launched \nour First Mile collection made from recycled \nplastic bottles.

In addition, we only use down feathers certified by the Responsible Down Standard\n, and 100% of our \nviscose is made by Lenzing, \none of the worldÕs leading viscose suppliers with a proven \ntrack record on sustainability.\n Therefore, \nmore than \n80% of our apparel products\n already are\n classified as \nmore \nsustainable \nproducts, in line with the definition \nin \nour PUMA Sustainability Index. \n In accessories we a\nlso \nhave made good progress: \n47% of our products are\n more sustainable.\n  \nCoverage and calculation are \nmore complex\n for footwear \nbecause a\nll our shoes are made from a \nnumber of \ncomponents. The main materials we use \ninclude \npolyester, polyurethane, rubber, leather\n, \nand nylon. In line \nwith our previous targets, we have achieved 98% coverage of LWG\n-certified leather. For the other \nmaterials, in 2020 our \nSourcing teams worked to find more sustainable solutions\n that also \nare cost\n-eff\nicient\n. For example, we\n now are using \nrecycled materials\n for all our counters and many of our linings\n and have \nreplaced \nthe polyester\n-based backing of all\n polyurethane (PU) materials, which we use\n as an \nalternative to leather, \nwith \nrecycled polyester.\n ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! Sustainability\n 64 By the end of 2020, 2\n4% of our \nfootwear products\n had at least one major component classified as more \nsustainable. This calculation is based on the use of 98% more sustai\nnable leather (from LWG\n-certified \ntanneries). In 2021, we will work on more accurate internal reporting \nand on scaling up \nthe use of \nmore \nsustainable material\ns \nwith a clear vision to achieve our 2025 targets. \n Besides switching our core materials to more s\nustainable versions, our \nproduct teams \nhave\n created several \nsustainability\n-focused collections and initiatives. Under our Forever Better Platform, we launched two \nlighthouse initiatives in 2020: \nFirst Mile\n, \nand our Day Zero collection in partnership with Central St. Martin\nÕs College, London.\n While First Mile emphasized the collection and recycling of used plastic bottles\n and on \nthe \nrelated \nhuman \nstories, our Day Zero collection was inspired by the severe water shortage in Cape Town, South Africa. It \nfocused\n on water saving technologies such as dope\n-dyed polyester or digital printing.\n Complementing our lighthouse initiatives, we had further sustainability focused collections in our product \n\nranges, for example our Time4change and Downtown collections\n. \n!!T.1\n8 \nDEVELOPMENT OF MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIAL USAGE\n* \nDivision\n Material Targets\n % of \nTotal \n2020  % of Total 2019\n  % of Total \n2018 Target \n2025 Apparel\n BCI c\notton\n: 99.4% Recycled cotton: 0.6%\n 100% BCI cotton: 80%\n Organic cotton: 2%\n 82% 50% 100% Polyester\n: \nbluesign\n¨: \n35.5%\n OEKO\n-TEX\n¨: \n45.35\n% \nRecycled\n: \n18.7%\n 99.5%\n bluesign\n¨: 55%\n OEKO\n-TEX\n¨: 42%\n Recycled: 1%\n 98% 66% 100%  RDS-certified down feathers\n 100%  100%  100%  Viscose\n from \ngreen\n-s\nhirt\n rated\n fiber p\nroducer\ns** \n100% Viscose\n from \ngreen\n-shirt\n rated \nfiber \nproducer\ns**\n  100%  100% Accessories\n BCI cotton: 100%\n      Polyester:\n bluesign\n¨: \n57.6%\n OEKO\n-TEX\n¨: \n40.4%\n Recycled\n: \n2.1%\n 100% bluesign\n¨: 54%\n OEKO\n-TEX\n¨: 46%\n 100% 46% 100% Footwear\n LWG Medal Rated \nleather/\nrecycled \nleather\n 97.9%\n  97.7\n% 99% 100% Recycled polyester\n 12.1%\n  6%      -  - TBD\n  Recycled or natural \nrubber 11.9%\n -  - NA  Recycled or solvent\n-free PU\n 0% -  - NA  Number of vegan styles\n 15     Product \npackaging\n Recycled paper and \n cardboard: 86.3%\n FSC-certified: 12.7% \n 99% Product \npackaging\n 100% 92% 100%        * \nFigures excluding trims and licensee production, in line with previours years\' reporting\n ** G\nreen\n-s\nhirt \nrated \nfiber producers, as determined by the annual Canopy Hot Button report, \nencourage existing fiber \nsuppliers to commit to CanopyStyle and a Canopy Audit\n (\nhttps://hotbutton.canopyplanet.org/\n). \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n!

Once \nextinct, species can never be brought back and are lost forever. \nNot only because \nour logo features a wild \nanimal, we have decided to dedicate one o\nf our 10FOR25 \ntargets\n to biodiversity.\n PUMAÕs impact on biodiversity is indirect \nyet\n severe. We us\ne \napproximately 30,000 tons of cotton and \n2,400 \ntons of leather\n per year for our products\n. Both cotton farming and cattle ranching require extensive land \nuse \nand have been cited to \nreduce \nbiodiversity, for example\n, \nby transitioning virgin forest to farmland in \nSouth America or deplet\ning the \nAral Lake in Central Asia for cotton farming\n during the Soviet Union era\n. \nIn addition, our annual paper and cardboard cons\numption amounts to 18,500 tons (supply chain only), the \nequivalent of 6\n,000 trees.\n To mitigate the loss\n of biodiversity resulting\n from \nthe production of our materials\n, we have set ambitious \ntargets\n: \nAs of 2020, 100% of our \ncotton fibers\n, 97.9% of our leath\ner, \nand 99% of our \ncardboard originate\ns \nfrom preferred sources such as BCI cotton, LWG\n-certified leather\n, and \nrecycled\n and/or FSC\n-certified \ncardboard.\n In addition, \nin \n2020 we mapped out our viscose supply chain to ensure \nthat \nwe procure 100% of our viscose\n from suppliers \ncommitted \nto reduc\ning\n the risk of sourcing from Ancient and Endangered Forests.\n \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n! Sustainability\n 66 In 2021, we will publish an updated Animal Welfare policy and plan to increase \nour \npreferred\n leather and \npaper/cardboard \nvolumes \nto 100%. \nNot least because \nwe a\nre a signatory to the Fashion Pact\n, we also will \ncontinue to expand our biodiversity strategy\n. \nENVIRONMENTAL PROFIT AND LOSS \nACCOUNT AND E-\nKPIS\n At PUMA, we pioneer\ned the concept of an EP&amp;L in 2011 \nwith the \npubli\ncation of our \nfirst corporate EP&amp;L on \nclimate and \nwater. Since then, the EP&amp;L has been expanded into other impact categories and \nhas been \nfurther \ndeveloped by Kering, PUMAÕs former majority owner. Today, we continue to collect supply chain \ndata to populate our PUMA EP&amp;L\n, which we consider \nto be \na good indicator o\nf \nwhere the highest impact lies \nwithin our value chain, rather than a precise measurement tool. \nBecause determining the individual values \nis very complex\n, we \nhave incorporated \nthe results of the 2019 EP&amp;L into\n this report.\n We plan to publish our \n2020 EP&amp;L in 2021.\n !!G.13 \nEP&amp;L RESULTS 2019\n  \n The chart above shows that the environmental impact of our value chain is dominated by material \nprocessing, while product assembly and raw material production also \nare \nimportant \nstages of \nour \nvalue \nchain\n.  ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n!

Sustainability\n 72 SUMMARY AND \nOUTLOOK Looking back at our last target cycle with the 10FOR20 Targets, we can say that we have achieved one of the \ntargets we had missed, related to the wastewater quality from our core suppliers with wet\n-processing \nfacilities. In 2019, we reported a failure to a\nchieve 90% compliance with the parameter of coliform bacteria. \nThis gap was closed in 2020. Likewise, we were able to achieve our long\n-term target of 15grams VOC per \npair of shoes, after having reported 15.4 grams in 2019. We exceeded our 90% target for mo\nre sustainable \ncotton, up from 82% in 2019 to 100% in 2020. This leaves us with only the air quality target open from the \n\nprevious target period, and we also made some progress here by checking a sample of 30 core \nfactories\n for \ncompliance to local air qual\nity regulations. The check revealed full compliance for all of the \nfactories\n reviewed. \n 2020 was dominated by the global \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic\n and the \nnew challenges \nit brought \nfor PUMA and our \nbusiness partners. Our strategy to collaborate closely with our core suppliers \nand wholesale partners paid \noff during this difficult period. As a result, we were able to limit order cancellations and support our \nsuppliers with our long\n-ter\nm Vendor \nFinancing \nProgram\n that \nis linked to sustainability. Taking this concept \nfurther, we \nalso \nsecured green financing tools for PUMA\n, \nin collaboration with ING and Bank of America.\n By and large, our 10FOR25 target cycle started out successfully. We sig\nnificantly increased our internal and \nexternal communications on more sustainable products via our Forever Better Platfor\nm \nhttps://about.puma.com/en/forever\n-better\n. \nAt the same time, we were able to \nsource 100% of our cotton, (close to 100%) polyester, viscose and down \n\nfeathers for our apparel and accessories ranges from responsible sources. Our footwear division also made \n\ngood progress, with nearly all leather as well as paper and cardboard coming fr\nom responsible sources.\n In addition to introducing \nmore sustainable versions\n for our base materials\n, we increased the \npercentage \nof \nrecycled polyester in apparel from 1% in 2019 to \n18.7%\n in 2020 and \nhave \nstarted to use recycled cotton \n(0.6%). In line with \nour circularity targets, we developed recycled options for leather, rubber\n, and \nnylon and \ntrained our \ndesign and \ndevelopment teams on the principles of circularity.\n The reduction of o\nur carbon footprint \ndue to the decrease in \nair\n-freight and employee busin\ness travel \nclearly can \nbe attributed to the \nCOVID\n-19 crisis. More importantly, we accelerated the transition to \nrenewable energy\n: We leas\ned the first six hydrogen cars \nfor PUMAÕs fleet, increas\ned our own renewable \nelectricity coverage to 100%\n, \nand assisted our suppliers \nwith \nintroducing\n on-site or off\n-site\n renewable \nenergy\n. The \nbase of our program \nhas been secured \nand we hope to be able to expand \nit \nto meet our \nambitious targets \nby \n2025. Last but \nnot least, \nwe are happy to report that \nthe pandemic \nhas caused \nthe PUMA family to \ncome even \ncloser together. We look forward to a great 2021 and will\n keep work\ning\n hard every day to continue our \nsustainability journey.\n ! \n  Annual Report \n2020     \n!

In this regard, PUMA \n\nfully commits to act in \naccordance with all international \ntax regulations and to fulfill any \ntax obligations arising\n from its \nbusiness activities.  \n  \nPUMA is not following artificial \n\nstructures solely to save taxes \n\nby those. Of course, taxes play a \n\nrole in business decisions so to \nknow those and so to do the \nright thing, however, tax \n\nconsequences are not the \n\nrelevant dr\nivers for failing a final \nsign off on business strategies \nin this regard. \n  \nIt is key for PUMA to pay an \n\nappropriate portion of its pre\n-tax \nprofit to tax administrations in \nthe respective countries. Paying \n\ntax is accepted as a general \nbusiness principle of\n PUMA. An \neffective tax rate of around 25% \nover the last years confirms to \n\nthis. As itÕs a general principle \nfor PUMA to follow tax rules and \nto pay applicable taxes, taxes as \nsuch are not a material issue \nwithin the sustainably approach. \n\nConsequently, Pum\na does not \nreport in detail on the GRI\n-Standard in this regard.\n      !

This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance \n\nengagement in a form that enables us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing has come to our \n\nattention that causes us to believe that the information disclosed in the Combined Non\n-Financial Report \nhas not complied, in all material respects, with Sections 315b, 315c in connection with Sections 289c to \n\n289e German Commercial Code (HGB). In a limited assurance engagement the assuranc\ne procedures are \n\nless in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and, therefore, a substantially lower level of \nassurance is obtained.

Combined Management Report\n 94 OVERVIEW 2020\n  Throughout 2020, the COVID\n-19 pandemic presented PUMA with several challenges that affected almost all \nparts of our business. When the pandemic started in China in January, some factories of our suppliers had \nto sh\nut d\nown or could not operate at full capacity, which was a challenge for our supply chain. To ensure the \nsafety and health of our customers and employees, we implemented hygiene measures at our offices, \nwarehouses and retail stores. As the virus spread to \nothe\nr parts of the world, large sporting events were \neither cancelled or postponed and most of our owned and operated stores had to be closed completely or \npartially in the second quarter. While the third quarter was once again very strong, new lockdowns a\nnd travel restrictions had a negative impact on our business in the fourth quarter. We had to quickly react to all \nof these changes. PUMAÕs mantra was to survive and manage this crisis short\n-term without hindering our \nmid\n-term momentum. Therefore, we deter\nmine\nd three key objectives: to limit the inevitable decline in sales \nas much as possible, to secure the supply chain and to reduce costs as well as to ensure liquidity.\n To make sure that our brand did not lose momentum, we continued to invest in a full lin\ne of\n products for the \nupcoming seasons and welcomed several new marketing partners. In September, we signed a long\n-term \ncontract with football star Neymar Jr., one of the most successful athletes of his generation. Neymar Jr. \n\nplayed in the PUMA KING footba\nll b\noot, which was also worn in the past by PUMA football legends Pel”, \nCruyff and Maradona. We also welcomed English singer and songwriter Dua Lipa as a WomenÕs \nambassador, who will appear in important campaigns for the brand. Canadian model Winnie Harlow\n joi\nned the PUMA family in early 2020, and already headed the marketing campaigns for several new footwear \nfranchises, including the KYRON and the MILE RIDER. \n We expanded our presence in basketball by signing one of the top picks of the 2020 NBA draft, La\nMelo\n Ball. \nAt the start of the year, we signed Grammy Award\n-winning artist J. Cole, who combines the worlds of music \nand basketball. PUMA also announced a partnership with creative director June Ambrose, who will create \ngirls and womenÕs collections throug\nhout 2021 and beyond.\n !MICHAEL \nL•MMERMANN\n CHIEF \nFINANCIAL\n OFFICER PUMA\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 95 In football, Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, and Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk as well as the national \nfederations of Iceland and Paraguay joined the PUMA family, just to name a few. To also expand our brandÕs \npresence in other teamsports\n, we\n signed the German Handball Federation. In track and field, we signed a \nnew partnership with the Australian and South African Athletics Federations. PUMA also signed Jamaican \nathletes Tajay Gayle, the long\n-jump World Champion, as well as Omar McLeod, t\nhe r\neigning Olympic \nChampion in 110\n-meter hurdles and the 2017 World Champion over the same distance.\n Our regular sell\n-in meetings, during which we usually welcome sales managers from all over the world in \nHerzogenaurach, were held digitally for the first \ntime\n in 2020 because of the pandemic. We also looked for \nways to design and develop our products digitally, without the need for people to travel to the factories in \n\nAsia, and with a reduced number of samples to be physically shipped from those factories t\no Ge\nrmany. For \nthe most part, we also communicated digitally with our retail partners, for example during pre\n-line and \nsell\n-in meetings.\n We maintained a strong dialogue with our manufacturers, customers, landlords, banks, logistic partners \n\nand other partne\nrs t\no ensure that we took measures together to sustain the entire value chain. To ensure \nthat our manufacturing partners could continue to operate, we cancelled as few orders as possible, while \n\nsecuring more favorable payment terms. We also worked with our\n ret\nail partners, logistic partners and \nsuppliers to adjust delivery dates and at the same time to extend payment terms to share the burden across \n\nthe whole value chain. \n Despite the crisis, we did not neglect the social and environmental aspects of our su\npply\n chain and \nannounced our ten new sustainability targets for 2025, 10FOR25. Examples of these targets include PUMAÕs \ncommitment to further lower its CO\n2 emissions and to use at least 75% recycled polyester across all \napparel and accessories products by 2025\n. We are also in the process of phasing out plastic bags from all of \nour retail stores globally.\n To further strengthen our e\n-commerce business in this \nexceptional time, we quickly reacted to the \nincreased demand in our e\n-commerce stores and strongly increa\nsed our investments in performance \nmarketing. We improved the speed of our e\n-commerce platform \nPUMA\n.com and adapted our offering to the \nstay\n-at-home si\ntuation by giving more space to leisurewear as well as sports apparel. Our e\n-commerce \nbusiness delivered \nstrong growth in 2020.\n We also made good progress with the upgrade of our logistics network, as we opened our new distribution \n\ncenter in Indianapolis, \nUSA. The center will speed up delivery times, as most US customers can now be \nreached within two days. We\n continued to work on our central European warehouse in Geiselwind, \nGermany, which is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2021.\n When sa\nles slowed down sharply in the first half of the year, we reacted quickly by reducing costs and cash \noutf\nlows wherever possible. We also secured additional liquidity to ensure that we could survive the crisis, \ntogether with our partners. In May, \nPUMA\n secur\ned a new credit facility of \n!900 million\n through a banking \nconsortium of twelve banks, including a direct participation of the Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau (KfW) of \n\n!625\n million\n. So far, we have not made use of this credit facility and by the end of the \nyear we reduced it by \n!700\n million\n to only \n!200\n million\n. In December, for refinancing purposes, \nPUMA\n secured\n new promissory \nnote loans of \n!250\n million\n and increased its existing credit lines at banks by \n!450 million\n. We used short\n-time work programs or com\nparable foreign schemes to reduce costs. The suspension of the dividend \npayment and the suspension of 100% of the Management BoardÕs salary as well as the reduction of salaries \n\nof our senior management by 25%\n-35% in April and May 2020 were essential measur\nes to reduce cash \noutflow.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 96 When many of our brand ambassadors and consumers were confined at home, we looked for new ways of \nengaging with our audience. We created a series of live videos on social media platforms, which we called \n#StrongerTogether. Thes\ne live videos included talks with our football ambassadors Sergio Agero and \nNikita Parris, yoga sessions with Sportstyle ambassador Cara Delevingne, interviews with Formula 1 driver \nMax Verstappen or workouts with pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis. Apart from \nsupporting PUMAÕs social \nmedia channels and e\n-commerce, these videos also created significant coverage in traditional media \noutlets.\n Even though regular competitions, such as the Olympic Games in Tokyo, were cancelled or postponed in \n2020, our athletes still\n entered the history books and set new personal bests. PUMA athlete Armand \nÒMondo\nÓ \nDuplantis entered the history books this year by\n setting a new pole vault world record. In \nFebruary, he cleared 6.18\n-meters at an indoor event and in September, he broke the\n 26-year\n-old outdoor \nrecord by jumping 6.15\n-meters. In June, Norway\'s Karsten Warholm achieved the current best result ever \nin a so\nlo race in the 300\n-metre hurdles. In motorsport, PUMA brand ambassador Sir Lewis Hamilton \nbecame Formula 1 World Champion for\n the seventh time, equaling Michael Schumacher\'s existing record of \nseven world titles. In golf, PUMA player Bryson DeChambeau won \nthe U.S. Open.\n The COVID\n-19 pandemic has shown that local relevance is key and that the market situation can vary \nsignificant\nly between regions. To reflect this, we empowered decision\n-making by local management even \nmore. Additionally, different countries \nhave different sports that people follow and participate in. One of the \nbest examples of local relevance is our partnership w\nith Virat Kohli, the captain of the Indian national \ncricket team. Cricket is by far the most popular sport in India and by partneri\nng with Virat, PUMA gains \ncredibility as a sports brand in India.\n PUMAÕs sales and business development in the financial year\n 2020 were characterized by temporal and \nregional differences during the course of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. PUMA started the year wit\nh a very \npositive order book and strong and balanced growth in all regions. Following a good start to the year for \nChina with\n double\n-digit sales growth in wholesale, e\n-commerce and our own retail stores, the Chinese \nmarket shut down in the last week of Jan\nuary. For the following six weeks, almost all business in China \n-with the exception of e\n-commerce \n- \ncame to a standstill. As \nChina began to recover from mid\n-March, the \nvirus spread around the world, leaving nearly 80% of our own retail stores and many of o\nur retail partnersÕ \nstores closed by the end of the first quarter. As a result, PUMAÕs sales declined by 1.3% currency\n-adjusted \nduring the first quarter. The business environment was particularly difficult in April and May, with most of \n\nour own stores and \nthose of our retail partners closed during this period. Retail stores began to open again \nfrom June onwards, initially in EME\nA and Asia, and later in North America. Due to this extremely difficult \nbusiness environment, PUMA recorded a currency\n-adjusted sales decrease of 30.7% during the second \nquarter. After 85% of PUMAÕs own retail stores reopened at the beginning of July and t\nhe business \nenvironment improved significantly, third\n-quarter sales saw a currency\n-adjusted increase of 13.3% year\n-on-year, driven \nby a very strong recovery in EMEA and the Americas. \n During the fourth quarter, however, the number of COVID\n-19 infections ag\nain rose sharply worldwide. This \nonce again led to restrictions and consumer sentiment worsened. PUMA nevertheless achieved a curre\nncy\n-adjusted sales growth of 9.1% in the fourth quarter. By adding up the four quarters, sales for the full year \n\n2020 recorde\nd a currency\n-adjusted decrease of 1.4%. In the reporting currency, the Euro, this corresponds \nto a decrease in sales of 4.9% from \n!5,502\n million\n in the previous year to \n!5,234\n million\n in 2020. PUMA \ntherefore managed to keep the sales decrease resulting fro\nm the COVID\n-19 pandemic in 2020 to a \nminimum.\n The negative impact of the COVID\n-19 pandemic not only affected PUMAÕs net sales, but \nwas also the main \nreason for the decline in profitability respectively operating result (EBIT) during the past financial year\n. PUMAÕs gross profit margin fell by 180 basis points from 48.8% in the previous year to 47.0% in 2020. This \n\nwas mainly due to nega\ntive currency exchange effects from hedging due to a less favorable annual average \nUS dollar hedging rate in 2020 compared to\n the previous year. In addition, increased sales promotions to \nlimit the decline in sales as far as possible and to optimize invent\nory levels, alongside increased write\n-downs on inventories, contributed to the decline in gross profit margin in 2020. By con\ntrast, the higher \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 97 share of sales from our own\n-retail activities, including our e\n-commerce business, and an improved regional \nsales \nmix had a slightly positive effect on the development of gross profit margin.\n The strong focus on cost\n-saving measures implem\nented directly in response to the COVID\n-19 pandemic at \nthe end of the first quarter and during the second quarter led to a 0.3% dec\nrease in other operating income \nand expenses during the financial year 2020. Nevertheless, compared to sales, the cost ratio \nincreased \nfrom 41.3% in the previous year to 43.3%. Higher costs for warehousing and logistics in connection with \n\nincreased e\n-comme\nrce business and higher write\n-downs on receivables were offset by reduced spending in \nsales and marketing.\n Due to the decline\n in sales and gross profit margin, which could not be compensated for by the reduction in \nother operating expenses, the operating result (EBIT) saw an overall decrease of 52.5%, from \n\n!440.2\n million\n in the previous year to \n!209.2\n million\n in 2020. This corre\nsponds to a decline in EBIT margin \nfrom 8.0% in the previous year to 4.0% in 2020. The declining financial result, resulting from h\nigher interest \nexpenses and higher negative currency conversion differences, also contributed to a 69.9% year\n-on-year \nreducti\non in consolidated net earnings and earnings per share in the past financial year. Consolidated net \nearnings fell from \n!262.4\n milli\non in the previous year to \n!78.9\n million\n, while earnings per share fell \naccordingly from \n!1.76 in the previous year to \n!0.53.\n This enabled PUMA to achieve positive net earnings \nand positive earnings per share d\nuring the past financial year, despite the sev\nere negative impact of the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic, particularly in the second quarter.\n Positive net earnings enable the Management\n Board and the Supervisory Board to propose a dividend \npayout of \n!0.16 per share for the financial year 2020 to the Annual General \nMeeting on May 5, 2021. This \ncorresponds to a payout ratio of 30.3% of consolidated net earnings and is in accordance with PU\nMAÕs \n\ndividend policy, which foresees a payout ratio of 25% to 35% of consolidated net earnings. However, \n\npayment is subject to the \ncondition that the macroeconomic conditions allow for a payout. The dividend was \nwaived in the previous year in order to redu\nce cash outflows during the COVID\n-19 pandemic.\n The performance of the PUMA share price during 2020 was also strongly influenced by \nthe negative effects \nof the COVID\n-19 pandemic. Based on the previous yearÕs numbers, PUMAÕs share price started 2020 at a \npri\nce of \n!68.35, before falling to a low of \n!42.14 in mid\n-March 2020, at the height of the COVID\n-19 crisis on \nthe capital markets worl\ndwide. The PUMA share price then recovered significantly from this low by the end \nof the year, rising to \n!92.28 \n- \nan increase\n of 35.0% on the previous year. The market capitalization of the \nPUMA Group increased accordingly to around \n!13.8 billion at \nyear\n-e\nnd 2020 (previous year: \n!10.2 billion).\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 98 PUMA GROUP ESSENTIAL INFORMATION\n COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n PUMA\n SE operates as a European stock corporation with Group headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. \nIn the internal reporting, ou\nr business activities are mapped according to three regions (EMEA, the \nAmericas and Asia/Pacific) and three product divisions\n (footwear, apparel and accessories). A detailed \ndescription can be found in the segment reporting in chapter 25 of the Notes to th\ne Consolidated Financial \nStatements.\n Our revenues are derived from the sale of products from the PUMA and Cobra Golf brands v\nia the \nwholesale and retail trade, as well as from sales directly to consumers in our own retail stores and online \nstores. We marke\nt and distribute our products worldwide primarily via our own subsidiaries. There are \ndistribution agreements in place with i\nndependent distributors in a small number of countries.\n As of December 31, 2020, 101 subsidiaries were controlled directly or indir\nectly by \nPUMA\n SE. Our \nsubsidiaries carry out various tasks at the local level, such as distribution, marketing, product \n\ndevel\nopment, sourcing and administration. A full list of all subsidiaries can be found in chapter 2 of the \nNotes to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n TARGETS AND STRATEGY\n PUMA has continued its brand mission to become the fastest sports brand in the world.\n Therefore, we \ncontinued to focus on the following six strategic priorities: create brand heat, develop product ran\nges that \n\nare right for our consumers, build a comprehensive offer for women, improve the quality of our distribution, \n\nincrease the speed and \nefficiency of our organizational infrastructure and strengthen our positioning in the \nNorth American market by leve\nraging our re\n-entry into basketball. In 2020, we also added an even stronger \nfocus on local relevance and sustainability as additional strate\ngic priorities for PUMA.\n For more than 70 years, PUMA has created \nbrand heat\n by partnering with the most famous and\n successful \nathletes: Usain Bolt, Sir Lewis Hamilton, Pel”, Maradona, Tommie Smith, Boris Becker, Linford Christie, \n\nSerena Williams, Heike Dr\nechsler and Martina Navratilova, just to name a few. Today, PUMA continues to \nstrengthen its position as a sports b\nrand through partnerships with some of the most famous \nambassadors: the Italian national football team, star strikers Antoine Griezmann, Rome\nlu Lukaku, Sergio \nAgero and Luis Suarez, top football manager Pep Guardiola, international top clubs Manchester Ci\nty, \nBorussia Dortmund, Valencia CF, Olympique Marseille and AC Milan, golf stars Lexi Thompson, Rickie \n\nFowler and Bryson DeChambeau, seven\n-time Formula 1 world champion Sir Lewis Hamilton, Norwegian \nhurdler and world champion Karsten Warholm, Canadian sprinter Andr” De Grasse, Swedish pole vault \n\nworld record holder Mondo Duplantis and the Jamaican and Cuban Olympic Federations. In 2020, we also\n added Brazilian football star Neymar Jr. to our roster of world\n-class assets, underlining our continued \nfocus on t\nhe football category. Teaming up with the best athletes, teams and federations is key in keeping \n\nthe credibility of the PUMA brand at the hig\nhest levels. To connect with young, trend\n-setting consumers, \nPUMA also drives brand heat by working with icons of c\nulture and fashion such as Selena Gomez, Cara \nDelevingne, Winnie Harlow and Dua Lipa. This has made PUMA one of the hottest sports and fashio\nn brands \nfor young consumers.\n PUMA aims to design Òcool stuff that worksÓ and in 2020, we significantly improved ou\nr product offering\n across all our business units. In performance footwear, we keep on moving forward with the revolutionary \nPUMA ULTRA footba\nll boot and our running &amp; training shoes based on our proprietary NITRO, HYBRID and \nXETIC technology platforms.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 99 In \nSportstyle, we continued to see strong sell\n-through of our key footwear product families of RS, RIDER, \nand CALI. The demand from our consumer\ns for these franchises has been maintained through the launch of \nstrong new models in 2020. The Classics pillar wit\nh models such as the iconic SUEDE, the RALPH \nSAMPSON or the SPEEDCAT also continued to perform strongly throughout the year.\n In apparel and a\nccessories, we saw a good development across the portfolio, especially from motorsport \nand basketball apparel as we\nll as our essentials offering, which includes socks and underwear.\n Our COBRA Golf and PUMA Golf business also showed a strong performance in \n2020, mainly driven by \nhigher sales of our innovative COBRA Golf clubs. Especially our COBRA Golf SPEEDZONE Drivers\n enjoyed \nmarket share growth globally with the introduction of the innovative CNC Milled Infinity Face leading to \n\nmaximum ball speed and high\ner precision \n- \na first in the golf industry.\n Creating a leading product offer for \nwomen\n remains a priority for PUMA\n and we continue our mission to be \nthe most fashion\n-forward sports brand for the female consumer. In 2020 we evolved our positioning of \nÒPUMA\n owns the space where the gym meets the runwayÓ as more and more women take up sports \nworldwide and athletic wear h\nas long made its way into everyday outfits. As we identified a culture shift in \nour female consumer from ÒmeÓ to ÒweÓ we defined our new ÒShe\n Moves UsÓ communications platform, \nwhich celebrates women who move together to achieve and connect \nÐ \nthrough sport\n, culture and values.\n Returning to \nbasketball\n, with an approach that resonated well on and off the court, was an important step \ntowards incre\nasing our credibility as a sports brand in North America. With the support of JAY\n-Z, our \nCreative Director for bask\netball, we developed a strong product offering across footwear, apparel and \naccessories that can be worn on and off the court. We also contin\nued to work with highly talented NBA \nplayers across several teams and gained great on\n-court visibility when PUMA at\nhletes Kyle Kuzma and \nDanny Green won this yearÕs NBA Championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. Signing a long\n-term \npartnership with the top \n2020 NBA prospect LaMelo Ball further underlines our commitment to basketball. \nOur basketball business also continu\nes to grow beyond the key North American market, and we saw \ncontinued strength in our performance basketball product portfolio and basketball\n inspired Sportstyle \nproduct families such as the RALPH SAMPSON.\n While basketball is especially important for North\n America, we also focused on ensuring \nstrong local \nrelevance\n in all our other markets worldwide. As the PUMA brand and products continue to r\nesonate well \naround the world, we see an increased need to focus on the sports, ambassadors, collaboration partners\n and communication platforms that are most relevant in the different markets. A good example for this is \n\nIndia, where we have a market\n-leadin\ng position in part due to our strong presence in the nationÕs most \npopular sport of cricket and our long\n-term partn\nership with Virat Kohli, the captain of the Indian national \ncricket team. We also continued to strengthen our position in other locally relev\nant sports such as handball, \n\nnetball, rugby or Australian rules football. Over the years, we have also established \na strong portfolio of \nlocally relevant brand ambassadors and influencers that complement our roster of top global assets and \n\nstrengthened our\n presence on locally relevant communication platforms such as Weibo, Youku or WeChat \nin China. In order to be close\nr to the market and to ensure a strong local relevance of our products, we also \nhave Regional Creation Centers in key markets such as North A\nmerica, Europe, India, China and Japan that \nwork in part on joint product creation projects with local collaboratio\nn partners.\n PUMA improved the quality of its \ndistribution\n and expanded its presence in key Sports Performance and \nSportstyle accounts around \nthe world. We continued to strengthen the relationships with our retailers by \nbeing a flexible and service\n-oriented\n business partner, also throughout the COVID\n-19 crisis. By improving \nsell\n-through, we further expanded the shelf space given to us in our partnersÕ retail stores. In parallel, we \nalso continued to invest in our direct\n-to-consumer business which includes ou\nr owned\n-and-operated retail \nstores as well as our e\n-commerce business. Due to mandatory store closures during the COVID\n-19 crisis \nand an acce\nlerated shift towards digital, we saw strong growth in our e\n-commerce business and invested in \nour respective front\n-end and back\n-end capabilities. We continued to improve the user experience and \nproduct offering on our existing e\n-commerce channels and launched a new e\n-commerce site in the \nimportant Mexican market. We also increased our investments into performance mark\neting to drive traffic \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 100 and conversion in all our e\n-commerce channels. Furthermore, PUMA continued to upgrade its owned\n-and-operated retail store network and opened selective new doors around the world.\n Operationally, we continued to improve \ninfrastructure\n, \nprocesses and systems that are required to support \nour overall growth ambition. In 2020, a strong focus was put on expanding our logistical \nnetwork in key \nmarkets. Our new, highly automated multi\n-channel distribution center in Indianapolis, USA successful\nly \nwent live in the second quarter of 2020 and an additional multi\n-channel distribution center in Geiselwind, \nGermany is expected to open in \nthe second quarter of 2021. New state\n-of-the\n-art distribution centers like \nthe ones in Geiselwind and Indianapolis \nare providing us with the required back\n-end infrastructure to \nsupport our future growth in the wholesale and direct\n-to-consumer channels.\n Bey\nond distribution center expansion, PUMA continued to focus on standardization of ERP systems and \nenhancements of product development tools. This, combined with improvements of the overall IT \ninfrastructure, enabled faster and better communication and infor\nmation exchange within PUMA and with \nour external partners. Due to the travel restrictions during the COVID\n-19 cris\nis, we also invested in \nadditional digital capabilities along the whole go\n-to-market process, from virtual product development to \nvirtual sel\nl-\nin meetings.\n In sourcing, the long\n-term collaboration with suppliers remains the key component of our \nsourcing strategy \nto ensure a stable sourcing base, consistent quality of our products and being well prepared for changes in \n\nthe trade environment. The\n strong collaboration with our suppliers, who are mainly based in Far East, has \nhelped us during the COV\nID-19 crisis and contributed to a very resilient supply chain situation throughout \nthe year.\n While social, economic and environmental \nsustainability\n has always been a core value for PUMA, we want \nto place an even higher strategic emphasis on this topic wit\nh a special focus on increasing the number of \nsustainable products in our ranges and stronger consumer\n-facing communication. In 2020 we officially \nannounced our 10FOR25 targets that outline our ambitious sustainability\n-related objectives until the year \n2025 and which link back to the United NationÕs Sustainable Development Goals. In 2020, we also launched \nour FOREVER BETTER communication platform that wil\nl serve as the overarching umbrella of all our \nconsumer\n-facing communication on sustainability. Because \nof our increased focus on developing more \nsustainable products, we successfully introduced the PUMA x FIRST MILE and PUMA x CENTRAL SAINT \n\nMARTINS sustai\nnability collections with strong feedback from our retailers and end consumers. Other \nproduct highlights\n include the Time4Change youth collection made of organic cotton. PUMA also continued \nits leading role at the Fashion Charter for Climate Action and con\ntinued to work with key stakeholders on \nall levels to promote more sustainable business practices within\n our industry. In relation to human rights, \nwe took all required actions to safeguard our suppliers and workers during the pandemic by honoring our \n\npurc\nhasing commitments and ensuring that all workplace safety and legal standards are met through our \nlong\n-s\ntanding social compliance program.\n PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN\n In 2020, we significantly improved our product offering across all our business units.\n As a company with \nmore than 70 years of history of moving sports and culture forward, our designers hav\ne access to a vast \n\narchive and often take inspiration for tomorrowÕs styles from yesterdayÕs classics.\n The RIDER, originally a running shoe from the 198\n0s, was one of our most important footwear styles in 2020 \nand it was introduced in several new versions and colors throughout the year.\n In our Sportstyle business unit, we continued to see strong sell\n-through of our main footwear franchises RS \nand CALI. The appetite from our consumers for these franchises was maintained, as we launched several \n\nnew models in \n2020, such as the RS Fast.\n The RS even found its way into our lineup of golf products, where it sold well as the RS\n-G golf shoe.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 101 Together with Grammy\n-winning artist J.Cole, PUMA also designed a basketball shoe that uses RS foam, the \nRS-DREAMER. It was worn\n on the basketball court by our PUMA Hoops athletes and sold out quickly.\n Classic silhouettes, including the iconic PUMA SUEDE or the SPEEDCAT, also con\ntinued to perform well \nthroughout the year. We brought together some of the most iconic shoes from our h\nistory, such as the \nRALPH SAMPSON, the ROMA and the RIDER to create the Rudolf Dassler Legacy Collection.\n In performance footwear, we continued to devel\nop the revolutionary PUMA ULTRA football boot, which was \nrelaunched in August as the ULTRA 1.1. This boo\nt featured PUMA exclusive MATRYXEVO\n¨ technology, which \nprovides a very high level of stability, durability and traction.\n In Motorsport, PUMA made the dr\neams of motorsport fans come true, as we sold the professional racing \nboot SPEEDCAT PRO, which Formula O\nne drivers such as Sir Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen or Charles \nLeclerc wear on race day, to a wider audience for the first time.\n In Running &amp; Training\n, shoes based on our proprietary HYBRID technology sold well. As part of a sponsored \nresearch collaborat\nion with MIT Design Lab, PUMA also developed a new cushioning technology called \nXETIC. It combines the properties of mechanical cushioning and foam. XET\nIC was first introduced in the \nCALIBRATE RUNNER and will continue to be used in footwear styles across d\nifferent business units.\n Our COBRA Golf and PUMA Golf business also showed a strong performance in 2020, driven by high sales of \nour innovative golf clu\nbs, such as the SPEEDZONE Driver. This product was used by Bryson DeChambeau to \nwin the U.S. Open, which\n boosted demand. PUMA Golf also launched the Excellent Golf Wear Collection, \nwhich was designed to perform on the course but remained routed in lifestyl\ne. In apparel and accessories, we saw a good development across the portfolio, especially in Motorsport,\n Core \nand Prime apparel, where we presented several special collections.\n Alongside PUMA ambassador and LGBTQ+ activist Cara Delevingne, we launched the \nÒFrom PUMA with \nLoveÓ pack to celebrate Pride Month. The Unity Collection highlighted PUMAÕs sports heri\ntage, and featured \n\nsimple black and white designs with pops of color, drawn from international flags. In a collaboration with \n\nNew York design studio Kid\nSuper, PUMA combined elements of football culture with retro tailoring, bold \nprints, vivid color combina\ntions.\n In Motorsport, PUMA released two legacy collections with Porsche, which were inspired by the history of \nthe German car brand and the legendary Po\nrsche 911 Turbo.\n We also continued to offer products for professional gamers and launched a new collecti\non with esports \nbrand Cloud9, which for the first time also included matching footwear.\n We also presented new collections with a focus on sustainability\n. Our sportswear collection with First Mile \nis made with recycled yarn that is manufactured from \nplastic bottles collected in the First Mile network. Our \ncollaboration with London\n-based design school Central Saint Martins implemented cutting edge dyeing \ntechnologies such as ÒDope DyeÓ and digital printing, to reduce the use of chemicals and water.\n Sti\nll at an experimental stage, our innovation department presented the ÒDesign to FadeÓ biodesign project, \nwhich explored sustainable alternatives for dyeing and\n making textiles.\n Research and product development at PUMA mainly comprise the areas of innovatio\nn (new technologies), \nproduct design and model and collection development. The research and product development activities \nrange from the analysis of scientifi\nc studies and customer surveys through the generation of creative ideas \nto the implementation of \ninnovations in commercial products. The activities in research and product \ndevelopment are directly linked to sourcing activities.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 102 As of December 31, 2020, a t\notal of 1,049 people were employed in research and development/ product \nmanagement (previous year\n: 999). In 2020, research and development/ product management expenses \ntotaled \n!102.6\n million\n (previous year: \n!114.3\n million\n), of which \n!56.6\n million\n (previous year: \n!61.7\n million\n) related to research and development.\n SOURCING\n THE SOURCING ORGANIZATION\n PUM\nA GroupÕs sourcing functions, referred to as PUMA Group sourcing (PGS), manages all sourcing \nrelated activities for PUMA and Cobra, including vendor selection, product development, price negotiation \nand production control. These activities are centrally ma\nnaged by PUMA International Trading GmbH (PIT), \nthe groupÕs global trading entity, with its head office in the Corporate headquarters in Herzogenaurach \n\n(Germany). In addition, PIT is responsible for procurement and supply into the PUMA distribution channel\ns worldwide. PIT receives volume forecasts from PUMA subsidiaries and licensees worldwide, translates \n\nthese forecasts into production plans which are subsequently distributed to the referenced vendors. The \n\nPUMA subsidiaries confirm their forecasts into pur\nchase orders to PIT, which in turn consolidates these \nrequirements and purchases from the vendors. There is a clear buy/sell relationship between the sales\n-subsidiaries and PIT and between PIT and the vendors, for added transparency.\n The centralization of both the sourcing and procurement functions, along with the rollout of a cloud\n-based \npurchase order collaboration and payment platform, linking the sales\n-subsidiaries, PIT and the vendors, \nhas enabled the digitalization of the supply chain creating transpa\nrency, operational efficiency and reducing \ncomplexity. For example, container fill rates are optimized, foreign currency risks are managed by PIT \n\ndirectly via a centralized currency hedging policy, and all payments to vendors are automated and paper \nfree.\n In order to meet our customersÕ requirements concerning service, quality, social and environmental \ncompliance we focus on six core strategic pillars of collaboration, product, quality, growth management, \n\nmargins and landed cost, and sustainability. The cen\ntralization of sourcing and procurement allows for \ncontinuous improvements in all of these areas.\n Furthermore, the integration of the PUMA sustainability function (social, environmental and chemical) into \nPGS, ensures these focus areas are part of our day \nto day business.\n This year has been exceptionally challenging for almost all parts of our business and not least for our \nsupply chain, especially in the first half of the year. When the COVID\n-19 pandemic first hit China and other \nparts of Asia, our supplie\nrs had to close their factories or could only operate at reduced capacity. We \nimmediately focused our efforts on tracking and restoring production capacities with our partners. As the \n\nsupply chain situation in Asia improved, Europe, America and the remaini\nng parts of the world were \nimpacted by COVID\n-19 and consequential lockdowns. Many stores of our wholesale partners, as well as our \nown retail stores, had to close temporarily and therefore no longer accepted new products. From the \n\nbeginning we emphasized t\nhe responsibility to find solutions in such exceptional circumstances together \nwith our partners. We wanted to sustain the entire value chain and get through this crisis together. PUMA \n\ncancelled very few orders with suppliers, in total less than 1% of the \ntotal order volume 2020. We agreed \nwith some suppliers on longer lead times in order to react to the decreased demand in the sales markets. \nWe were in close conversation with our manufacturers, customers, lessors, banks, logistics partners and \nother partne\nrs to find solutions and, for example, to extend payment terms in order to spread the burden of \nthe COVID\n-19 pandemic across the entire value chain.\n Another key aspect to mitigate the impact on the supply chain was the PUMA Vendor Financing Program, \n\nwhich \nhas been in place since 2016 and saw increased adoption among our partners during this year. The \nprogram allows vendors to be paid earlier and is bas\ned on PUMA\'s credit rating. The International Finance \nCorporation (IFC), the banks BNP Paribas and HSBC, as\n well as our newest partner Standard Chartered, \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 103 offer our suppliers attractive financing conditions and the opportunity to maintain their own credit \nlines \nunder this program.\n THE SOURCING MARKETS\n During the financial year 2020, PIT purchased from 139 indep\nendent suppliers (previous year: 131) in 31 \ncountries worldwide. Strategic cooperation with long\n-standing partners not only remained one of the key \ncompetitive advantages, but also proved crucial in 2020 to ensure stable sourcing in such exceptional times.\n Asia remains the strongest sourcing region overall with 96% of the total volume, followed by EMEA with 2% \n(thereof Europe with 1% and Africa with 1%) and the Americas with 2%.\n As a result, the six most important sourcing countries (94% of the total volume\n) are all located on the Asian \ncontinent. Once more, Vietnam was the strongest production country with a total of 35%. Vietnam thus \n\ncontinued to incr\nease its share of the sourcing volume by two percentage points compared to 2019. China \nfollowed at 26%. Ban\ngladesh, which focuses on apparel, is in third place at 14%. Cambodia was in fourth \nplace at 13%. Indonesia, which focuses on footwear production, pr\noduces 4% of the total volume and is in \nfifth place. India is in sixth place at 2%.\n Rising wage costs, fluc\ntuating commodity prices and macroeconomic influences, such as changes in the \ntrade environment due to tariffs, have continued to influence sourcing \nmarkets in 2020. Such impacts need \nto be taken into account in allocating the production to ensure a secure\n and competitive sourcing of \nproducts. In this regard sourcing has extended its local supply chain for the China sales\n-subsidiary to \nprovide the righ\nt organizational setup with a focus on design, costing and lead time. To mitigate the \nnegative impact of th\ne international trade environment, alternative sourcing locations for the US market \nhave been used since the fourth quarter of 2019.\n !!G.01 \nSOURCING RE\nGIONS OF PUMA \n(in %)\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 104 EMPLOYEES NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES\n The global number of employees on a \nyearly average\n was 13,016 employees in 2020, compared to 13,348 in \nthe previous year. The annual average number of employees saw a slight decline due to short\n-time wo\nrk \nprograms or comparable foreign schemes as a result of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. Personnel expenses \ndecreased overall by 8.9% in 2020, from \n!640.5\n million\n to \n!583.7\n million\n. On average, personnel expenses \nper employee were \n!44.8 thousand, compared to \n!48.0 \nthousand in the previous year.\n !!G.0\n2 \nDEVELOPMENT EMPLOYEES\n  As of \nDecember 31, 2020\n, the number of employee\ns was 14,374, compared to 14,332 in the previous year. \nThis represents a slight increase of 0.3% in the number of employees compared to the previous year. The \ndevelopment in the number of employees per area is as follows:\n !!G.0\n3 \nEMPLOYEES \n(Year\n-e\nnd) ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 105 TALENT RECRUITMENT AND DEVELOPMENT\n The past financial year has been marked by the extraordinary challenges posed by the global COVID\n-19 pandemic.\n Nevertheless, we have managed to successfully master all that 2020 threw at us, adapting \nlocally to the new conditi\nons as quickly as possible \n- \nwith our main focus being on the well\n-being of our \nemployees. The development of our organization through digital transformation and the establishment of \nan agile learning platform and culture provided the basis for this rapid adaptability. This was another \n\nreason why we were able to keep our business operating as smoothly as possible during the various phases \n\nof e\nxtensive social distancing measures imposed by governments around the world and the expansion of \nexisting mobile wor\nking (working from home) arrangements within the workforce. The provision of \nadditional IT equipment and targeted support for the mental wel\nl-\nbeing of our employees during the crisis \nwere key elements. During these COVID\n-19 times, of course particular emph\nasis was placed on creating a \nsafe working environment and avoiding financial cuts for our employees. Thanks to the strong feeling of \n\nsolida\nrity and a high level of engagement among our employees, we feel well\n-positioned to continue along \nour path to further growth.\n To further expand our position in the market, it is crucial to have highly qualified and motivated staff whom \n\nwe can retain for t\nhe long term. Particularly in this constantly changing and increasingly complex \nenvironment, the creativity and inno\nvative strength of our employees are an important element in ensuring \nour competitiveness and facilitating growth in the future.\n We use digi\ntal platforms and social media for our target group\n-specific, individual recruiting measures, as \nwell as our career website, to attract external candidates. A range of initiatives at universities gives us the \nopportunity to approach potential employees and\n identify suitable candidates. Extensive networks of \nqualified applicants and candidate pools help us to quickly fil\nl vacancies. In the competitive labor market, \nbeing an attractive employer and being perceived as such by current and potential employees ar\ne of critical \nimportance. Top employer rankings and multiple awards evidence PUMA\'s attractiveness.\n Digitalization a\nnd the associated global simplification and acceleration of business processes were driven \nforward in 2020. Since 2017, we have been using t\nhe ÒWorkday\nÓ \nsoftware solution for almost all personnel \nprocesses. This software provides employees and managers wit\nh the processes and tools required for daily \npersonnel management. In addition, easy\n-to-use dashboards provide managers with the information\n and data\n-driven insights they need for planning and management. The analysis of our centrally available global \ndata\n provides a solid basis for strategic decisions and measurable results.\n Our aim is to develop our employees in an international environment \nand at the same time successfully and \nsustainably retain them in our company. Based on the Workday software, a syste\nmatic succession plan is \ncreated as part of talent management in addition to the performance assessment and target\n-setting. We \nidentify the \ntalent available within the group as part of annual performance reviews and global talent \nconferences and foster tal\nent development based on individual development plans. This type of talent \nmanagement means that we can offer our employees attractive caree\nr and development opportunities. \nOver the past year, we continued to fill the majority of our key positions through \ninternal promotions or \nhorizontal moves around the world.\n In order to cope with the dynamic changes in the market and be successful in the l\nong run, it is essential \nthat our workforce has the necessary expertise to guarantee continuous growth and market co\nmpetence, \nparticularly in times of major transformation and extensive change. We ensure this through the ongoing \nprofessional and personal d\nevelopment of our employees. For this reason, we expanded the range of \n\ntraining that we provide, which includes a nu\nmber of online and offline training courses and workshops, \neither standardized or tailored to individual needs, even further in 2020. With \nÒLinkedIn Learning\nÓ \nand ÒGood Habitz\nÓ \nour employees have been able to access more than 16,500 different online traini\nng courses \nsince the beginning of last year. A wide range of learning categories are available for self\n-directed personal \nand professional development. Learning content covering topics such as mental well\n-being, resilience, \nmindfulness and emotional stabil\nity in particular helped us as an employer to provide the best possible \nsupport to our employees around the world in this exceptional situat\nion. Due to social distancing measures, \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 106 face\n-to-face training was largely replaced with digital options so that we c\nould continue to offer these \ncourses.\n With a range of apprenticeships and dual\n-study programs, as well as study\n-related internships, we offer \nadequate entry\n-level and development opportunities for talented individuals at all levels. In addition, we \nactivel\ny promote the systematic development of our professionals and managers.\n All managers worldwide complete our internal global leadership train\ning program, consisting of the ILP \n(Ò\nInternational Leadership Program\nÓ) and ILP\n". In this way, we ensure a common un\nderstanding of \nleadership globally throughout the company. The program helps to develop participants over a longer \nperiod, provides them with the opportunities to apply the newly acquired knowledge in practice between the \nindividual modules and to share kn\nowledge with other seminar participants to learn from each other. They \nreceive intensive training and coaching, including interactive learning, role play simulations and best \n\npractice learning, as well as joint\n projects. The digitalization and the changing\n work environment lead to \nnew challenges for managers in particular. The key topics are therefore coaching, mindful leadership and \n\nagile working methods. The training course \nÒfrom employee to manager\nÓ \nprepares \nstaff that are about to \ntake on a management r\nole for the first time. In addition to the training module, the program also offers \nindividual coaching.\n Using Speed Up and Speed Up\n", we conduct development programs for employees at different levels. \nVarious groups consisting of top talents are given int\nensive preparation for the next step in their careers by \ntaking on interdisciplinary projects and tasks, targeted training courses, mentoring and coaching, as well \n\nas job rotations. Increased visibility\n to upper management, the creation of cross\n-functional\n cooperation and \nestablishing a strong network are also important components of this program.\n WORKS COUNCIL\n The trust\n-based collaboration with the Works Councils is an important part of our corporate cu\nlture. In \n2020, the European Works Council of \nPUMA\n SE represented employees from 13 European countries and \nhad 16 members. The German Works Council of \nPUMA\n SE has 15 members and represents the employees \nof the PUMA Group in Germany. A designated member of \nthe Works Councils represents the interests of \nemployees with disabilities.\n COMPENSATION\n We at PUMA offer our employees a targeted and competitive compensation system, which consists of \nseveral components. In addition to a fixed base salary, the PUMA bonus\n system, profit\n-sharing programs \nand various social be\nnefits form part of an attractive and performance\n-based compensation system. In \naddition, we offer our employees comprehensive services in the areas of further development, employee \nmotivation, health m\nanagement and wellbeing. We also offer long\n-term incentive programs for the senior \nmanagement level that honor the sustainable development and performance of the business. The bonus \nsystem is transparent and globally standardized. Incentives are exclusivel\ny linked to company goals. Due to \nthe global COVID\n-19 pandemic, members of senior management around the world voluntarily gave up part \nof their base salary and the entire long\n-term incentive for 2020 to improve cash flow and earnings. To \nreward the special\n efforts made by our employees in this challenging time, we also gave a PUMA product \nvoucher to all PUMA Group employees worldwide. This is particularly beneficial to employees in the lower \n\npay grades.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 107 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n We use a variety of \nindicators to \nmanage\n our performance in relation to our top corporate goals. We have \ndefined \ngrowth and profitability as key targets\n within finance\n-related areas. Our focus therefore is on \nimproving sales and operating result (EBIT). These are the financial control para\nmeters that are of \nparticular significance. Moreover, \nwe aim to minimize working capital and improve free cash flow. Our \nGroupÕs \nPlanning and Management System\n has been designed to provide a variety of instruments in order \nto assess current business develo\npments and derive future strategy and investment decis\nions. This involves \nthe continuous monitoring of key financial indicators within the PUMA Group and a monthly comparison \nwith budget targets. Any deviations from the targets are analyzed in detail and a\nppropriate \ncountermeasures are taken in the event such\n deviations have a negative impact.\n Changes in net sales are also influenced by \ncurrency exchange effects\n. This is why we also state any \nchanges in sales in Euro, the reporting currency, adjusted for cu\nrrency exchange effects in order to provide \ninformatio\nn that is relevant to the decision\n-making process when assessing the revenue position. \nCurrency\n-adjusted sales are used for comparison purposes and are based on the values that would arise if \nthe foreig\nn currencies included in the consolidated financial st\natements were not translated at the average \nrates for the previous reporting year, but were instead translated at the corresponding average rates for \nthe current year. As a result, currency\n-adjusted fig\nures are not to be regarded as a substitute or as \nsupe\nrior financial indicators, but should instead always be regarded as additional information.\n We use the indicator \nfree cash flow\n in order to determine the change in cash and cash equivalents after \ndeduct\ning all expenses incurred to maintain or expand the or\nganic business of the PUMA Group. Free cash \nflow is calculated from the cash flow from operating activities and investment activities. We also use the \nindicator \nfree cash flow before acquisitions\n, which\n goes beyond free cash flow and includes an adjustment\n for incoming and outgoing payments that are associated with shareholdings.\n We use the indicator \nworking capital\n in order to assess the financial position. Working capital is essentially \nthe difference \nbetween current assets \n- \nincluding in particular inven\ntories and trade receivables \n- \nand current liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents, the positive and negative market values of derivative financial \n\ninstruments and current finance and lease liabilities a\nre not included in working capital.\n Non\n-financial perf\normance indicators are of only minor importance at PUMA\n. \nThe calculation of the key financial control parameters that PUMA uses is defined as follows:\n The recognition of net sales is based on the provis\nions of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers.\n PUMAÕs gross profit margin is calculated as cost of sales divided by net sales. Cost of sales mainly \n\ncomprise the carrying amounts of inventory that were recognized as expenses during the reporting per\niod.\n PUMAÕs operating result (EBIT) is the sum of net \nsales and royalty and commission income, minus cost of \nsales and other operating income and expenses (OPEX). EBIT is defined as operating result, less \ndepreciation and amortization, provisions and impai\nrment loss, before interest (= financial result) and \nbefore taxes. The financial result includes interest income and interest expenses as well as currency \nconversion differences. The EBIT margin is calculated as EBIT divided by net sales.\n PUMAÕs working ca\npital is calculated based on the sum of current assets\n less the sum of current liabilities. \nIn addition, cash and cash equivalents and positive and negative market values of derivative financial \ninstruments are deducted. The market values of derivative fin\nancial instruments are recognized in the \nbalance sheet\n in the items Other Current Assets and Other Current Liabilities, not attributable to working \ncapital. Current financial and lease liabilities are also not part of working capital.\n We also use the EBITD\nA indicator, which represents the operating result bef\nore interest (= financial result), \ntaxes and depreciation and amortization, to assess the results of operations. EBITDA is calculated based on \n\nthe operating result (EBIT) adding depreciation and amortiz\nation, which may also contain any incurred \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 108 impairment \nexpenses relating to fixed assets and financial assets. The EBITDA margin is calculated as \nEBITDA divided by net sales.\n INFORMATION REGARDING THE NON\n-FINANCIAL REPORT\n In accordance with Sections 289b an\nd 315b of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuc\nh - \nHGB), \nwe are required to make a non\n-financial declaration for \nPUMA\n SE and the PUMA Group within the \nCombined Management Report or present a non\n-financial report external to the Combined Management \nReport, in which we report on environmental, social and\n other non\n-financial aspects. PUMA has been \npublishing Sustainability Reports since 2003 under the provisions of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and \n\nsince 2010 has published financial data and key\n sustainability indicators in one report. In this cont\next, we \nreport the information required under Sections 289b and 315b of the HGB in the Sustainability chapter of \nour Annual Report. The Non\n-financial Report for the financial year 2020 will be available\n by April 30, 2021, \nat the latest on the following page of our website: \nhttps://about.\nPUMA.com\n/en/investor\n-relations/financial\n-reports\n Furthermore, important sustainability information can always be found in the Sustainability section of \nPUMAÕs website: \nhttp://about.\nPUMA.com\n/en/sustainability\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 109 ECONOMIC REPOR\nT \nGENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\n GLOBAL ECONOMY\n According to the winter forecast iss\nued by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (ifw Kiel) dated \nDecember 16, 2020, in the past financial year the global economy suffered a historic downturn due to the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic. The experts at ifw Kiel expect global gross domestic product (GDP) \nto decline by 3.8% \noverall in 2020, which is by far the strongest economic decline in the past 70 years. Following the drastic \neconomic downturn caused by the COVID\n-19 pandemi\nc in the spring, the global economy recovered strongly \nuntil the fall; however, g\nrowth weakened during the fourth quarter as a result of a further wave of infections \nand the measures to contain it. Nevertheless, with the exception of only a few countries, economic \n\ndevelopment remains on an upward trend, especially in Europe. This is du\ne, not least, to the continued \nstrong expansionary monetary policy pursued by central banks in industrialized countries. The majority of \nthese banks have again extended the ex\npansionary measures they introduced in the spring in response to \nthe COVID\n-19 cri\nsis, or have pushed back expectations for the timing of tightening measures. Interest rates \nin the emerging markets have also tended to fall further in recent months. Expansio\nnary economic policies \nand an expectation of overcoming the pandemic, mainly due \nto success in the development of an effective \nvaccine against COVID\n-19, are already being reflected in the financial markets.\n SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY\n 2020 was a very difficult\n year for the sporting goods industry. Wide\n-reaching lockdown measures and \narea\n-wide retail store closures aimed at containing the COVID\n-19 pandemic had a very negative impact on the \nsporting goods industry worldwide, particularly during the second quarter\n. Furthermore, this could only be \npartially offset by rising e\n-commerce sal\nes. In addition, the sporting goods industry was further impacted by \nthe cancellation or postponement of major sporting events, such as the European Football Championship \nand the To\nkyo Olympic Games. However, as a result of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, more exer\ncise and physical \nactivity, as well as an increasingly healthy and sustainable lifestyle, continued to gain in importance for an \never\n-increasing proportion of the worldÕs population\n. The Òstay\n-at-homeÓ situation has also resulted in the \nincreased popularit\ny of athletic footwear and leisure/athletic apparel as an integral part of everyday fashion \n\n(ÒathleisureÓ).\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 110 SALES ILLUSTRATION OF SALES DEVELOPMENT IN 2020 COMPARED TO THE OUTLOOK\n PUMAÕs 2019 Management Report had predicted a currency\n-adjusted growth in \nnet sales of around 10% for \nthe financial year 2020. However, due to the significant negative impact and considerable uncertainty of the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic, this forecast had to be w\nithdrawn when the results were published for the first quarter \nof 2020.\n Mor\ne details on sales development in the financial year 2020 are provided below.\n NET SALES\n PUMAÕs net sales in the reporting currency Euro decreased by 4.9% to \n!5,234.4\n million\n in the financial year \n2020 as a result of the worldwide negative impact of the COV\nID-19 pandemic (previous year: \n!5,502.2\n million\n).

A decline in sales was recorded in all categories except Sportstyle, \nMotorsport and Basketball. The share of the Apparel division increased sl\nightly to 37.7% of Group sales \n(previous year: 37.6%).\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

PUMAÕs royalty and commission \n\nincome decreased by 36.0% to \n!16.1\n million\n in the financial year 2020. Alongside the negative effects of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, this decrease was due, among other things, to the expiry of license agreements at the \nend of 2019.\n REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n In the following explanation of the regional distribution of sales, the sales are allocated to the customerÕs \n\nactual reg\nion (Òcustomer siteÓ). It is divided into three geographical regions (EMEA, the Americas and \n\nAsia/Pacific).

Currency\n-adjusted sales decreased by 3.0%. Both Nort\nh America and Latin America recorded negative currency \nexchange effects and a decrease in\n sales. In particular, the weakness of the Argentine peso against the \nEuro had a significant negative impact on sales in Latin America in the reporting currency, the E\nuro. The \nshare of the Americas region in Group sales decreased slightly from 35.3% in the\n previous year to 33.9% in \n2020. With regard to product divisions, both Footwear (currency\n-adjusted \n-3.3%) and Apparel (currency\n-adjusted \n-9.6%) recorded a decline in \nsales compared to the previous year. By contrast, sales in the Accessories \ndivision saw a\n currency\n-adjusted increase of 9.5%, due in particular to an increase in sales of Cobra golf \nclubs, socks and bodywear.\n !!G.08 AMERICAS SALES\n (! million\n)  \nIn the \nAsia/Pacific\n region, sales fell in the reporting currency, the Euro, by 5.2% to \n!1,476.3\n millio\nn.

Combined Management Report\n 115 ILLUSTRATION OF EARNINGS DEVELOPMENT IN 2020 COMPARED TO THE OUTLOOK\n In \nthe outlook of the 2019 Annual Report, PUMA forecasted a slight improvement in the gross profit margin \nfor the financial year 2020. PUMA \nexpected a slightly weaker increase of other operating income and \nexpenses (OPEX) compared to net sales. The forecast for the operating result (EBIT) was within a range of \nbetween \n!500 million\n and !520 million\n. In addition, a significant improvement in net\n earnings was expected \nfor the financial year 2020. However, due to the significant negative impact and considerable un\ncertainty of \nthe COVID\n-19 pandemic, this forecast had to be withdrawn when the results were published for the first \nquarter of 2020.\n More\n details on earnings development in the past financial year are provided below.\n GROSS PROFIT MARGIN\n PUMAÕs gross profit\n in the financial year 2020 decreased by 8.5% from \n!2,686.4\n million\n to \n!2,458.0\n million\n. The gross profit margin fell by 180 basis points from 48.8% to 47.0%. This was mainly due to negative \n\ncurrency exchange effects from hedging due to a less favorable an\nnual average US dollar hedging rate in \n2020 compared to the previous year. In addition, increased sales promotions to limit the decline in sales as \nfar as possible and to optimize inventory levels, alongside increased write\n-downs on inventories, \ncontribute\nd to the decline in gross profit margin in 2020. In contrast, the higher proportion of sales from \nour own\n-retail activities and an improved regional sales mix had a slightly positive effect on the \ndevelopment of gross profit margin.\n The gross profit margin\n in the Footwear division decreased from 46.4% in the previous year to 45.7% in \n2020. The Apparel gross profit margin fell from 51.1% to 48.5%, and in Accessories it also decreased from \n\n50.5% to 47.0%.\n !!G.10 GROSS PROFIT/GROSS PROFIT MARGIN\n  ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 116 OTHER OPERAT\nING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n The strong focus on cost\n-saving measures implemented directly in response to the COVID\n-19 pandemic at \nthe end of the first quarter and during the second quarter led to a slight decrease in other operating income \nand expenses of 0.3%\n, from \n!2,271.3\n million\n to \n!2,264.9\n million\n in the financial year 2020. Nevertheless, \ncompared to sales, the cost ratio increased from 41.3% in the previous year to 43.3%.\n !!G.11 OPERATING EXPENSES\n (! million\n)  Within sales expenses, marketi\nng/ retail expen\nses decreased by 5.6% to \n!1.050,2\n million\n, while the cost \nratio remained almost unchanged compared to the previous year at 20.1% of sales. Other sales expenses, \nwhich mainly include sales\n-related costs and costs for warehousing and logistic\ns, increased by \n4.9% to \n!743.9\n million\n. This increase was mainly due to higher costs for warehousing and logistics in connection \nwith the increased e\n-commerce business. The cost ratio of the other sales expenses was 14.2% of sales in \n2020 compared to a cos\nt ratio of 12.9%\n in the previous year.\n Research and development/ product management expenses decreased by 10.2% to \n!102.6\n million\n compared to the previous year and the cost ratio fell slightly to 2.0%. Other operating income in the past \n\nfinancial year amou\nnted to \n!0.4\n mil\nlion\n and consisted primarily of income arising from the sale of fixed \nassets. General and administrative expenses increased by 8.5% to \n!368.8\n million\n in 2020, mainly due to \nincreased write\n-downs on receivables, as the negative macroeconomic\n impact of the C\nOVID\n-19 pandemic \nincreased the risk of default on receivables in the financial year 2020. This led to an increase in the cost \n\nratio of general and administrative expenses to 7.0%. Depreciation and amortization is included in the \n\nrelevant co\nsts and total \n!275.7\n million\n (previous year: \n!246.4\n million\n). In addition, the respective costs \ninclude impairment losses relating to goodwill and right\n-of-use assets totaling \n!18.0\n million\n (previous year: \n!0.0\n million\n). RESULT BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPR\nECIATION AND AMO\nRTIZATION (EBITDA)\n The result before interest (= financial result), taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) decreased by \n\n26.8%, from \n!686.6\n million\n to \n!502.9\n million\n, in the financial year 2020. The EBITDA margin reduced \naccordingly f\nrom 12.5% in the\n previous year to 9.6% in 2020.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 117 OPERATING RESULT (EBIT)\n The decline in sales and gross profit margin due to the negative impact of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, which \ncould not be compensated for by the reduction in other operating \nexpenses, led to an overall decrease in \nthe operating result (EBIT) of 52.5%, from \n!440.2\n million\n in the previous year to \n!209.2\n million\n in 2020. This \ncorresponds to a decline in EBIT margin from 8.0% in the previous year to 4.0% in 2020.\n !!G.12 OPERATING RE\nSULT - \nEBIT\n  FINANCIAL RESUL\nT \nThe financial result decreased in 2020 from a total of \n!-22.6\n million\n in the previous year to \n!-46.8\n million\n. This development is attributable, on the one hand, to losses from currency conversion differences \namounting to \n!-3.9 \nmillion\n in 2020 compared to\n gains from currency conversion of \n!10.2\n million\n in the \nprevious year. On the other hand, the interest result, the net balance of interest income and interest \n\nexpenses, fell from a total of \n!-32.8\n million\n in the previous year t\no !-42.9\n million\n in 2020. The\n decrease in \ninterest result was mainly attributable to an increase of \n!11.6\n million\n in expenses from interest \ncomponents related to cash flow hedging (Òswap pointsÓ).\n EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES (EBT)\n In the financial year 2020, PUM\nA generated earnings before t\naxes of \n!162.3\n million\n. This corresponds to a \ndecrease of 61.1% compared to the previous year (\n!417.6\n million\n). Tax expenses were \n!39.2\n million\n compared to \n!108.6\n million\n in the previous year, while the tax rate decreased sligh\ntly from 26.0% to 24.2% \nin 20\n20. NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON\n-CONTROLLING INTERESTS\n Net earnings attributable to non\n-controlling interests relate to companies in the North American market, in \neach of which the same shareholder holds a minority stake. T\nhe earnings attributable to these interests \ndecreased by 5.1% to \n!44.2\n million\n in the financial year 2020 (previous year: \n!46.6\n million\n). These \ncompanies concern PUMA United North America and PUMA United Canada. The business purpose of these \n\ncompanies is t\nhe sale of socks, bodywear an\nd childrenÕs apparel on the North American market.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 118 NET EARNINGS\n In the financial year 2020, consolidated net earnings decreased by 69.9% from \n!262.4\n million\n to \n!78.9\n million\n, enabling PUMA to achieve positive net \nearnings despite the significant negative\n effects of the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic. Earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased accordingly from \n!1.76 \nin the previous year to \n!0.53 in 2020.\n DIVIDENDS\n Based on the positive net earnings, the Manageme\nnt Board and the Supervisory Board propos\ne to the \nAnnual General Meeting on May 5, 2021 that a dividend of \n!0.16 per share be paid out from retained \nearnings of \nPUMA\n SE for the financial year 2020. The payout ratio for financial year 2020 is 30.3% of \nconso\nlidated net earnings. This is in accordan\nce with \nPUMA\n SEÕs dividend policy, which foresees a payout \nratio of 25% to 35% of consolidated net earnings. The payment of the dividend is to take place in the days \nafter the Annual General Meeting at which the dec\nision is made on the payout. However, pay\nment is subject \nto the condition that the macroeconomic conditions allow for a payout.

T\nhis decrease was due \nto lower earnings before taxes (EBT \n-61.1%). In contrast, non\n-cash expenses increased as a result of the \nincrease in right\n-of-use assets, which led to higher depreciation and amortization in 2020.\n !!G.16 GROSS CASH FLOW\n (! million\n)  A s\ntrong focus on working capital management significantly contributed to the fact that the cash outflow \nfrom the change in net current assets* improved from \n!-44.5\n million\n in the previous year to \n!-11.9\n million\n in the financial year 2020. The \ncash outflow fr\nom tax payments and dividends received decreased from \n !-111.5\n million\n in the previous year to \n!-89.3\n million\n. Overall, this resulted in a decrease in net cash from \noperating activities by \n!127.3\n million\n, from \n!548.8\n million\n to \n!421.5\n millio\nn. Despite the \nsignificant negative \nimpact of the COVID\n-19 pandemic in 2020, PUMA was therefore able to largely limit the decline in net cash \nfrom operating activities.\n NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n Net cash used in investing activities decreased i\nn the financial\n year 2020, from \n!218.7\n million\n to \n!145.5\n million\n. Due to the significant negative impact of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, we reacted quickly and \nadjusted our investment planning for 2020 accordingly to limit cash outflows as far as possible. This \nresulted in a d\necrease of investments in fixed assets from \n!218.4\n million\n in the previous year to \n!151.0\n million\n in 2020. The investments mainly concerned logistics and IT infrastructure. As a result of the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic, investments in own retail stor\nes declined in \nthe past financial year.\n * \nNet current assets include working capital line items plus current assets and liabilities, which are not part of the working \ncapital calculation.

In addition, an adjustment is made for incoming and outgoing payments that relate t\no shareholdings, where ap\nplicable.\n Free cash flow before acquisitions decreased from \n!331.2\n million\n in the previous year to \n!276.0\n million\n in \nthe financial year 2020.

This decrease re\nsulted, on the one hand, from the \nwaiver of dividend payments for the financial year 2019 to \nPUMA\n SE shareholders, in order to limit cash \noutflows in 2020 as far as possible\n during the course of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. On the other hand, \nproceeds from borro\nwings of \n!94.2\n million\n in 2020, compared with the repayment of financial liabilities of \n!17.6\n million\n in the previous year, contributed to the decrease in net cash used in financing activities.\n The net cash used in financing activities also included payout\ns to non\n-controlling interests totaling \n!45.6\n million\n (previous year: \n!18.6\n million\n) and the repayment of lease liabilities and related interest \nexpenses totaling \n!164.3\n mil\nlion\n in 2020 (previous year: \n!170.5\n million\n). As of December 31, 2020, PUMA had cas\nh and cash equivalents of \n!655.9\n million\n, an increase of 26.6% \ncompared to the previous year (\n!518.1\n million\n). The PUMA Group also had credit lines totaling \n!1,639.1\n million\n as of December 31, 2020 (previous year: \n!687.6\n million\n). Unutilized credit lines t\notaled \n!1,372.7\n million\n on the balance sheet date, compared to \n!514.1\n million\n in the previous year. In order to \nensure the liquidity of the PUMA Group, even in the event of a longer lasting pandemic, we have therefore \nsecured additional credit lines in the\n past financial year as a contingency reserve, in line with our strategic \npriorities for dealing with the COVID\n-19 pandemic.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 125 STATEMENT REGARDING THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT A\nND THE OVERALL \nSITUATION OF THE GROUP\n 2020 was a very difficult year for the sporti\nng goods industry due to the COVID\n-19 pandemic. Our approach \nwas to manage the crisis short term without hindering PUMAÕs mid\n-term momentum. Accordingly, our \nprimary goal wa\ns to survive the crisis, to recover and then to emerge stronger from the crisis wit\nh growth. \nThe health and safety of our employees, business partners and customers were given top priority. We were \nalso very focused on limiting the inevitable decline in sa\nles wherever possible, protecting the supply chain, \nreducing costs and securing liq\nuidity.\n With respect to our organizational development and progress within our logistics network, the opening of \nthe new Indianapolis distribution center in the USA was a ma\njor milestone for PUMA. In addition, work \ncontinued in 2020 at our new logistics ce\nnter for Central Europe located in Geiselwind, Germany, which is \nexpected to become operational in the second quarter of 2021. \n We are very proud of how we have handled this\n difficult period so far. Our employees worldwide have \nhelped us survive this crisi\ns thanks to their flexibility, pragmatism, determination and positive attitude. In \ndoing so, they have worked closely with our manufacturers, customers, lessors, banks, logi\nstics partners \nand other partners to ensure that we are able to find solutions toge\nther to maintain the business and value \nchain. Our long\n-standing and reliable cooperation with many of our partners was one of the most important \nsuccess factors for us in m\nanaging the pandemic during the past financial year.\n The sales development seen in \nthe individual quarters, which varied considerably during the year due to the \ndevelopment of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, resulted in a currency\n-adjusted sales decrease of 1.4% fo\nr the full \nyear 2020 compared to 2019. While sales in wholesale and in our own reta\nil stores declined, our e\n-commerce business recorded significant sales growth. PUMA therefore managed to keep the sales \ndecrease resulting from the COVID\n-19 pandemic in 2020\n to a minimum. However, despite the cost reduction \nmeasures initiated immediately a\nt the end of the first quarter and during the second quarter, the COVID\n-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on our profitability. As a result of the decline in sal\nes and gross \nprofit margin, which could not be compensated for by cost\n-saving measu\nres, our operating result (EBIT) \nsaw an overall decrease of 52.5% to \n!209.2\n million\n in 2020 (previous year: \n!440.2\n million\n). Earnings per \nshare amounted to \n!0.53 in 2020 (pr\nevious year: \n!1.76). Despite the severe negative impact of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, p\narticularly in the second quarter, PUMA was thus able to achieve positive net earni\nngs and \npositive earnings per share for the full year 2020.\n With regard to the balance she\net, we believe that PUMA continues to have an extremely solid capital base. \nAs of t\nhe balance sheet date, the PUMA GroupÕs equity amounted to more than \n!1.7 billion and the equity \nratio was just under 38%.\n Our consistent focus on strict working capital man\nagement and our efforts to secure our liquidity in 2020 \nhave resulted in an increas\ne in cash and cash equivalents (to \n!655.9\n million\n) and an increase in our \nunutilized credit lines as of the balance sheet date (to \n!1,372.7\n million\n). In this context, the ne\nw credit line \nof \n!900 million\n, taken out in May last year via a banking consortium \nof twelve banks \n- \nincluding a direct \ncommitment by the German state\n-owned development bank KfW (Kreditanstalt f Wiederaufbau) in the \namount of \n!625 million\n - \nwas already r\neduced by \n!700 million\n to just \n!200\n million\n at the end of 2020, as \nPUMA\n secured\n new promissory note loans of \n!250 million\n in December 2020 for refinancing purposes and \nincreased its existing credit lines with banks by \n!450\n million\n. \nAs a result, the net \nasset, financial and income situation of the PUMA Group is overall solid at the time t\nhe Combined Management Report was prepared. This enables the Management Board and the Supervisory \n\nBoard to propose to the Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2021, a dividen\nd of \n!0.16 per share for the \nfinancial year 2020. This corresponds to a payout ratio of 30.3% in relation to the consolidated net earnings \n\nand is in line with our dividend policy.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

The decrease in personnel expenses was related to short\n-term work programs resulting from the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic and lower perfo\nrmance\n-related staff bonuses. Other operating expenses decreased \nyear\n-on-year due to cost\n-saving measures implemented directly in response to the COVID\n-19 pandemic at \nthe end of the first quarter and during the second quarter. However, the decrease in mark\neting and\n administration expenses was partially offset by higher costs for warehousing and logistics.\n The financial result\n improved by 60.8% compared to the previous year, to \n!359.5\n million\n. The increase was \nmainly due to significantly higher dividends from shareho\nldings in affiliated companies, while the income \nfrom the transfer of profits from affiliated companies decreased and expenses from loss transfers \nincreased.\n Despite a slight decline in sales, the decreased expenses and the improved financial resu\nlt led to\n a significant increase in \nearnings before taxes\n of 195.9%, from \n!81.3\n million\n in the previous year to \n!240.7\n million\n in 2020. \nTaxes on income\n amounted to \n!11.0\n million\n (previous year: \n!12.8\n million\n).

In contrast, receivables and other \ncurrent assets fell by 16.0% to \n!424.3\n million\n compared to the previous year. This de\nvelopment is primarily \ndue to the decrease in receivables from affiliated companies.

The objective of the compensation system is to stimul\nate the \nimplementation of long\n-term Group strategy by ensuring that the relevant success parameters that govern \nthe performance\n-based compensation are aligned with the \nPUMA\n SE managemen\nt system. Furthermore, \nthe long\n-term interests of our shareholders are taken into account by making the variable compensation \nstrongly dependent on the performance of the \nPUMA\n SE share.\n With a greater share of performance\n-based and therefore variable compe\nnsation, the intention is to reward \nthe contribution of our Management \nBoard members towards a sustainable development of our Company, \nwhile negative deviations from the set targets will result in a significant reduction of variable compensation.\n An update\nd Management Board compensation system that complies with the requireme\nnts of the German \nAct Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der zweiten \nAktion−rsrechterichtlinie, ARUG II) and the recommendations of the German Co\nrporate Governance Code \nas amended on December 16, 2019 is to be submit\nted to the Annual General Meeting for approval on May 5, \n2021. GOVERNANCE IN COMPENSATION MATTERS\n It is the responsibility of the \nPUMA\n SE Supervisory Board to determine the compensation\n of the \nManagement Board. The entire Supervisory Board decides on matte\nrs relating to the compensation of the \nManagement Board members based on the respective recommendations of the Personnel Committee \nwhich is comprised of members of the Supervisory Board\n. Criteria for calculating the total compensation \nare the responsibilit\nies and performance of the individual Management Board member, the economic \nsituation of \nPUMA\n SE, long\n-term strategic planning and related goals, the sustainability of targeted results \nand the CompanyÕs long\n-term prospects.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 133 OVERVIEW OF COMPENSATION ELEME\nNTS\n The compensation of the Management Board consists of non\n-performance\n-based and performance\n-based \ncomponents. The non\n-performance\n-based components comprise the basic compensation, co\nmpany \npension contributions and other fringe benefits, while the perfor\nmance\n-based components are divided into \ntwo parts, a bonus and a component with long\n-term incentive effect:\n !!G.18 TARGET COMPENSATION STRUCTURE\n  CHANGE IN COMPENSATION COMPONENTS IN 202\n0 DUE TO THE COVID\n-19 PANDEMIC AND LOAN \nCOMMITMENTS FROM KFW BANKENGRUP\nPE At the beginning of the COVID\n-19 pandemic in March 2020, all members of the Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE voluntarily waived their respective basic compensation for the months of April\n and May 2020 to \nshow solidarity with those employees of PUMA for whom short\n-time work was applied for and with other \nemployees who also forwent part of their remuneration for the months of April and May 2020. For the same \nreason, all members of the Superv\nisory Board also waived part of their annual compensation.\n In addition,\n all members of the Management Board waived their respective bonus payment for the financial \nyear 2020, including the bonus for the individual performance of members of the Management B\noard. The \nManagement Board thus complied with a requirement for the gra\nnting of a loan with the participation of \nKfW Bankengruppe. Nevertheless, provisions of \n!1.9\n million\n were set up in the financial year 2020 for a \nlong\n-term incentive program in 2020 on account of individual contractual obligations toward the members \nof the\n Management Board. In 2021, the Supervisory Board will decide on the provision of a long\n-term \nincentive program for the financial year 2020 and will grant an allocation only on the condition that doing so \nis in compliance with the requirements of KfW Banke\nngruppe.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 134 TARGET COMPENSATION STRUCTURE\n NON\n-PERFORMANCE\n-BASED COMPENSATION AND FRINGE BENEFITS\n Basic Compensation\n The members of the Management Board receive a fixed basic salary which is paid monthly. This salary is \nbased on the duties and \nresponsibiliti\nes of the member of the Management Board. For employment periods \nof less than twelve months in a calendar year, all compensation payments are paid on a prorated basis. For \nthe months of April and May 2020, the members of the Management Board \nvoluntarily wa\nived their basic \ncompensation.\n Fringe Benefits\n In addition, the Management Board members receive in\n-kind compensation, such as use of company cars, \naccident insurance and D&amp;O insurance. These are part of the \nnon-performance\n-based compensation.\n Company Pens\nion\n Pension benefits are available for the members of the Management Board in the form of deferred \n\ncompensation paid out of the performance\n-based and/or the non\n-performance\n-based compensation, for \nwhich the C\nompany has taken out pension liability insurance\n. The proportion of the pension capital that is \nalready financed through contributions to the pension liability insurance is deemed to be vested.\n Performance\n-based Compensation\n In addition to the non\n-performa\nnce\n-based compensation, the members of the Manag\nement Board receive \nperformance\n-based and therefore variable compensation. The amount of this compensation is based on the \nattainment of previously defined financial and non\n-financial targets. It consists of \na bonus and a component \nwith a long\n-term incenti\nve effect. In the event of any outstanding performance, the Supervisory Board may, \nat its discretion, grant the members of the Management Board a voluntary one\n-off payment.\n Short\n-term variable Compensation \nÑ \nBonus\n All members of the Management Board waived\n short\n-term variable compensation for the financial year \n2020. However, the short\n-term variable compensation system as it would have been applied if the \nManagement Board had not waived it in 2020 is described\n below for the sake of completeness.\n As part of \nthe performance\n-based compensation, the bonus is primarily based on the financial goals of the \noperating result (EBIT) and free cash flow (FCF) of the PUMA Group and the individual performance of the \n\nrespecti\nve Management Board member as well as the attain\nment of Group\n-wide sustainability targets. The \ntwo financial success targets are weighted with 60% for EBIT and 20%, respectively, for FCF. The individual \n\nperformance is included in the calculation with a weighting of 15%. The degree to which the sustainab\nility \ntargets have been achieved is taken into account in the calculation with a weighting of 5%. If 100% of the \ntarget is achieved (\nÒtarget bonus\nÓ), the amount of the bonus is 100% of the annual basic compen\nsation for \nthe Chair of the Management Board and\n the Management Board members.\n The aforementioned performance targets are combined. For EBIT, FCF and the sustainability targets, the \nbandwidth of possible target attainments ranges from 0% to 150%. It is the\nrefore possible that no short\n-term variable comp\nensation at all is paid out if minimum targets are not attained.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 135 !!G.19 STI-PLAN  An identical target attainment curve has been created, respectively, for the two financial goals. If the budget \ntarget for EBIT\n or FCF is reached, the target attainment is 100\n% (target value). If EBIT/FCF are less than \n95% of the target value, this results in a target attainment of 0%. If EBIT/FCF reach 95% of the target value, \n\nthe target attainment is 50%. If EBIT/FCF reach 120% \nor more of the target value, the target attainme\nnt is \nlimited to 150% (maximum value). Target attainments between the determined target attainment points are \n\ninterpolated. This results in the following target attainment curve for the EBIT and FCF performan\nce targets:\n !!G.20 TARGET ATTAINMENT CURVE EBIT/FC\nF \n Individual Performance Target Attainment\n The Supervisory Board assesses the individual performance of the Management Board member based on \npreviously defined criteria, such as sustainable \nleadership, strategic vision and good corporate governance. \nThe Supervisory Board determines target criteria for assessing individual performance every year. At the \nend of the performance period, the Supervisory Board evaluates the degree of attainment of \nthe target \ncriteria. Target attainment can be between 0% and 150\n%. Target Attainment Sustainability Targets\n The sustainability targets include goals to reduce CO\n2 emissions, compliance targets and occupational \nhealth and safety objectives. They are applied\n throughout the PUMA Group and measured quantitatively on \na stan\ndardized basis. The Supervisory Board determines four target criteria for calculating the \nsustainability targets every year. At the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board evaluat\nes the \ndegree of attainment of the target criteria. Target attai\nnment can be between 0% and 150%.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 136 Long-term variable share\n-based compensation\n In the financial year 2020, no long\n-term variable compensation was granted to members of the \nManagement Board. The\n Supervisory Board thus complied with a requirement for the gran\nting of a loan \nwith the participation of KfW Bankengruppe. Nevertheless, provisions of \n!1.9\n million\n were set up in the \nfinancial year 2020 for a long\n-term incentive program in 2020 on account \nof individual contractual \nobligations toward the members of the \nManagement Board. In 2021, the Supervisory Board will decide on \nthe provision of a long\n-term incentive program for the financial year 2020 and will grant an allocation only \non the condition that doing so is in compliance with the requirements of KfW Banken\ngruppe. The long\n-term \nincentive program then to be granted will be in line with the compensation system that will be presented for \napproval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.\n Rules for Te\nrminating Management Board Activity and other Contractual Provis\nions\n In the event of a temporary disablement due to illness, the Management Board member retains his or her \nentitlement to full contractual compensation up to a total duration of six months bu\nt for no longer than the \nend of the employment contract. The Management Board member must offset payments received from \n\nhealth insurance companies or pension insurances in the form of sick pay or pension benefits against the \n\ncompensation payments, insofar \nas these benefits are not fully based on contributions by the Ma\nnagement \nBoard member.\n In the case of an early termination of the employment contract without good cause within the meaning of \n\nsection 626 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB), any payments to b\ne agreed to the Management Board \nmember, including fringe benefi\nts, will not exceed the amount of two annual compensations (severance \ncap) and must not exceed the value of the compensation for the remaining duration of the Management \n\nBoard employment contr\nact. The calculation of the severance cap is based on the total \ncompensation of the \npast financial year and also on any expected total compensation for the current financial year. In the event \n\nof an early termination of the employment contract before the e\nnd of the relevant performance period for \nthe bonus and/or the t\nhree\n-year vesting period of the long\n-term variable compensation, the contract makes \nno provision for an early payout of the variable compensation components. If the member of the \n\nManagement Bo\nard becomes permanently disabled during the term of the employme\nnt contract, the \ncontract is terminated on the day on which the permanent disability is determined. A permanent disability \nexists within the meaning of this provision, if the member of the Management Board is no longer able, due \nto illness or accident, to \nfulfill the responsibilities assigned to him or her. In this respect, the specific duties \nand particular responsibility of the member of the Management Board must be taken into account.\n If the\n member of the Management Board dies during the term of the empl\noyment contract, his or her widow \nor widower and children, provided they have not yet reached the age of 27, are entitled as joint creditors to \n\nreceive the unreduced continued payment of the f\nixed compensation for the month in which the death \noccurred and \nfor the six following months, but for no longer than up to the end of the regular term of the \ncontract.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

The proportion of the pension capital that is \nalready financed through contribut\nions to the pension liability insurance is deemed to be vested. During the \nfinancial year, PUMA allocated \n!0.4\n million\n for members of the Management Board (previous y\near: \n!0.4\n million\n). The present value of the pension benefits granted to active Management\n Board members of \n!13.0\n million\n as of December 31, 2020 (previous year: \n!10.8\n million\n) was netted against the equally high \nand pledged asset value of the pension liab\nility insurance on the balance sheet. The majority of the present \nvalue is attributable to\n the pension benefits financed by deferred compensation.\n COMPENSATION FOR FORMER MANAGEMENT BOARD MEMBERS\n In the reporting year, \n!0.8\n million\n was spent on pro\n-rata ba\nsic compensation, pro\n-rata fringe benefits and \nshort\n-term and long\n-term variable compensat\nion for former members of the Management Board.\n There were pension obligations to former members of the Management Board and their widows/widowers \namounting to \n!3.2\n m\nillion\n (previous year: \n!3.3\n million\n) as well as contribution\n-based pension \ncommitments \nin connection with the deferred compensation of former members of the Management Board and Managing \n\nDirectors amounting to \n!11.3\n million\n (previous year: \n!11.6\n million\n). Both items were recognized as \nliabilities within pension provisions to the \nextent they were not offset against asset values of an equal \namount. Pension obligations to former members of the Management Board and their widows/widowers \n\nwere incurred amounting \nto \n!0.2\n million\n (previous year: \n!0.2\n million\n). SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPENSATI\nON SYSTEM\n In the reporting year, all members of the Supervisory Board waived part of their annual compensation. The \n\nfollowing describes the Supervisory Board compensation system if \nno components are waived.\n The Supervisory Board compensation system has bee\nn changed to purely fixed compensation. The Articles \n\nof Association were amended following the shareholders\' decision at the Annual General Meeting on May 7, \n\n2020. As for the Manage\nment Board, the relevant criteria for calculating the compensation are the \nresponsibilities and performance of the individual Supervisory Board member, the economic situation of \nPUMA\n SE, the long\n-term strategic planning and related goals, the sustainabilit\ny of achieved results and the \nCompanyÕs long\n-term prospects. For this reaso\nn, the Supervisory Board compensation consists of a fixed, \nnon-performance\n-based amount.\n The Supervisory Board compensation conforms to ¤ 15 of the Articles of Association, according to which \neach Supervisory Board member receives a fixed annual compensation of \n! 25,000.00. This amount is \npayable after the Annual General Meeting for the respective financial year. In addition to the fixed, annual \ncompensation, the members of the Super\nvisory Board are entitled to an increase of their fixed \ncompensation based \non their position on the board and their membership of committees. The Chair of the \nSupervisory Board and the Vice Chair receive an additional fixed annual amount of \n! 25,000.00 and \n ! 12,500.00, respectively. The chair of a committee additionally receives\n ! 10,000.00, and the members of a \ncommittee \n! 5,000.00, respectively. The respective committees are the Personnel Committee, the Audit \nCommittee and the Sustainability Committee.\n A member of the Supervisory Board who is only active for part of a financial\n year receives prorated \nremuneration calculated on the basis of the period of activity determined for full months.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

Transparent and responsible corporate governance is a\n key prerequisite for achieving \ncorporate targets and for increasing the CompanyÕs value in a sustainable manner. The Manage\nment and \nthe Supervisory Board work closely with each other in the interests of the entire Company to ensure that \nthe Company is man\naged and monitored in an efficient way that will ensure sustainable added value \nthrough good corporate governance. In the fo\nllowing the Management Board and the Supervisory Board \nreport on the corporate governance at \nPUMA\n SE in accordance with Principle 22\n of the German Corporate \nGovernance Code (DCGK). This section also includes the Statement of Compliance in accordance with A\nrt. \n9(1)c(ii) of the SE Regulation (SE\n-VO) in conjunction with Section 289f and Section 315d German Commercial \nCode (HGB). Pursuant \nto Section 317(2) Sentence 6 of the HGB, the purpose of the audit of the statements \npursuant to Section 289f (2) and (5) and\n Section 315d of the HGB is limited to determining whether such \nstatements have actually been provided.\n PUMA\n SE has the legal form o\nf a European company (Societas Europaea, or SE). Being a SE headquartered \nin Germany, \nPUMA\n SE is subject to European and Ger\nman law for SEs while remaining subject to German \nstock corporation law. As a company listed in Germany, \nPUMA\n SE adheres to the German Corporate \nGovernance Code.\n PUMA\n SE has a dual management system featuring strict personal and functional separation betwe\nen the \nManagement Board and the Supervisory Board (two\n-tier board). Accordingly, the Management Board \nmanages the company while the Supervisory Board monitors and advise\ns the Management Board.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 140 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE PURSUANT TO SECTION 161 AKTG FOR 2020\n: \nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE declare that \n- \nsince the last Statement of \nCompliance from November 9, 2019 \n- \nPUMA\n SE has been and will be in\n compliance with the \nrecommendations issued by the ÒGovernment Commission on the German\n Corporate Governance CodeÓ in \nits version dated February 7, 2017 (ÒCode 2017Ó) and its version dated December 16, 2019 (effective as of \nMarch 20, 2020, ÒCode 2020Ó), wi\nth the exceptions mentioned below.\n EXCEPTIONS TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CODE 2017\n In the period since the last Statement of Compliance was issued on November 9, 2019, the following \nrecommendations of the Code 2017 have not been complied with. With the \nannouncement of the Code 2020 \n\non March 20, 2020, the Code 2017, which was valid until t\nhen, was replaced by the Code 2020.\n ¥!In derogation of No. 3.8 p. 3 of the Code 2017, members of the Supervisory Board are provided with D&amp;O \n\ninsurance with no deductible. \nThe Supervisory Board feels that it can dispense with a deductible for \n\nmembers of the S\nupervisory Board, because the D&amp;O insurance is group insurance for people in \nGermany and abroad, and a deductible is fairly unusual abroad.\n ¥!In derogation of No. 4.2.3 p.\n 2 s. 6 of the Code 2017 the compensation of the members of the \nManagement Board does n\not show the maximum amount limits in total or their variable compensation \ncomponents. This is due to the fact that neither the existing PUMA Monetary Units Plans \n\n2016/2017/2018 nor the PUMA Board Member Bonus Plan nor the discretionary extra bonus clause \n\nprovide for a maximum amount.

The Statements of Compliance of the past \nfive years are also accessible on this website.\n RELEVANT DISCLOSURES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES THAT ARE APPLIED BEYOND \n THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n In order to fulfill our eco\nlogical and social responsibility as a global sporting goods manufacturer, PUMA \nhas devel\noped groupwide guidelines on environmental management and on compliance with workplace and \nsocial standards. PUMA is convinced that only on such a foundation can a las\nting and sustainable corporate \nsuccess be achieved. That is why PUMA is committed to the \nprinciples of the UN Global Compact. The \nPUMA Code of Conduct prescribes ethical and environmental standards with which both employees and \nsuppliers are required to co\nmply. Detailed information on the company\'s corporate social responsibility \nstrategy can \nbe found in the Sustainability section of the Annual Report or on the company\'s homepage \n(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://about./nPUMA/n.com/n">http://about.\nPUMA\n.com\n</a> under \nÒSUSTAINABILITY\nÓ). COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n PUMAÕs management acts in compliance with laws and self\n-imposed standards of conduct. PUMA\n has set \nup a Compliance Management System (CMS) to systematically prevent, detect and sanction violations in the \n\nareas of corruption, money laundering, conflicts of i\nnterest, antitrust law, fraud and embezzlement. \nViolations of the law or internal guideli\nnes will not be tolerated.\n The PUMA Code of Ethics is an important building block of the CMS and is binding for employees of all \n\nsubsidiaries worldwide. It defines the\n guidelines and values that shape PUMA\'s identity. PUMA expects all \nemployees to be aware of these values and to act accordingly. The Code of Ethics contains rules, among \n\nother things, on dealing with conflicts of interest and personal data and prohibits i\nnsider trading, anti\n-competitive behavior and corruption in any form. In order to fa\nmiliarize employees with the rules of the \nCode of Ethics and to establish uniform behavioral guidelines, the Code of Ethics is flanked by specific \nGroup\n-wide guidelines.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 142 All employees are familiarized with the regulatory areas of the Code of Ethics throu\ngh ongoing mandatory \ne-\nlearning. In addition, employees selected on the basis of risk\n-based principles are given in\n-depth \nknowledge in classroom training or more comprehens\nive e\n-learnings. In 2020, the e\n-learning on the Code \nof Ethics covered the topics of\n anti\n-corruption and reporting of compliance violations (Òspeak up cultureÓ). \nAll PUMA employees were encouraged by the CEO of \nPUMA\n SE to complete the e\n-learning. The clear\n Tone from the Top resulted in 98.7% of PUMA employees Group\n-wide (98.3% \nPUMA\n SE) su\nccessfully completing \nthe e\n-learning on the Code of Ethics. In\n-depth e\n-learning took place in the area of antitrust law for all sales \nemployees in the PUMA Group. 99% of the employees in the target group completed the e\n-learning. Due to \nthe COVID\n-19 pandem\nic, classroom training was replaced by virtual training. For example, a \nÒtrain the \ntrainer\nÓ \ncourse was held for employees from the Social Sustainability area. These were th\nen able to \ncommunicate PUMA\'s expectations in the areas of anti\n-corruption and confl\nict of interest clearly and \nconsistently in their own training sessions with sourcing suppliers.\n In 2020 PUMA developed a comprehensive Business Partner Due Diligence Polic\ny. Upon a risk\n-based \napproach all existing processes regarding the onboarding of hig\nh-\nrisk business partners were analyzed, \nconsolidated and redefined. In the future, the due diligence process will be supported by a compliance \nscreening tool to which all l\nocal compliance officers will have access.\n The Management Board is responsible for t\nhe proper functioning of the CMS. It is supported by a \ncompliance organization consisting of the Chief Compliance Officer and compliance officers in the main \n\noperating Grou\np companies. The Chief Compliance Officer of \nPUMA\n SE reports directly to the CEO of \nPUMA\n SE. The local Compliance Officers also serve as direct contact persons for employees and support \nthem by appropriate communication measures as well as in dealing with \nand processing compliance \nincidents. To facilitate cooperation within the global com\npliance organization, regular virtual meetings are \nheld with local Compliance Officers. These provide an opportunity to exchange experience and knowledge. \n\nThis informal exc\nhange of information is supplemented by a compliance reporting process, which was \n\ndocumented and formalized in written form in 2020. This process includes, among other things, that the \n\nChief Compliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee of the Supervis\nory Board of \nPUMA\n SE about the \ncurrent status of the implementation of compliance st\nructures and serious compliance violations. The Chief \n\nCompliance Officer works closely with the Legal Department and Internal Audit. In addition, regular \n\nmeetings of the \nÒP\nUMA\n SE Risk &amp; Compliance Committee\nÓ \ntake place. At the meetings of this committee, \ncompliance risks are analyzed and evaluated and appropriate measures (guidelines, training, etc.) are \ndefined and approved. The review of the implementation of the requireme\nnts in the compliance guidelines \nis regularly part of the audit plan of the internal\n audit department.\n PUMA has a Group\n-wide electronic whistleblower platform, which is operated by an external provider and \nto which employees and third parties can report pr\notected illegal or unethical conduct. Violations from all \nrisk areas can be reported\n. Insofar as they do not fall within the competence of the compliance \norganization, the responsible specialist departments are responsible for identifying and taking measures. \n\nThe introduction of the platform was communicated throughout the Group by the CE\nO and the \ncommunication was flanked by appropriate information material. Every year, the local compliance officers \nexpressly draw attention to the whistleblower system thro\nugh appropriate communication measures or in \nface\n-to-face training sessions. Whistle\nblowers who report misconduct in good faith are protected from \nretaliation. All reports are followed up immediately and, if confirmed, appropriate measures are taken. In \n2020, the Compliance department at headquarters received 47 reports of alleged violati\nons. The majority of \ncases did not fall within the remit of the Compliance department. In two cases from 2019 in which \n\nallegations of corruption were made, the investigatio\nn was concluded in 2020 without the allegations being \nconfirmed. In addition to the \nwhistleblower platform, there is a global hotline for whistleblowers from the \nsupply chain.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 143 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKING PRACTICES OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND \n THE SUPERVIS\nORY BOARD\n PUMA\n SE has three bodies \nÐ \nthe Management Board, the Supervisory Board and\n the Annual General \nMeeting.\n MANAGEMENT BOARD\n The Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE manages the company on its own responsibility with the goal of \nsustainable value creation. It \ndevelops PUMA\'s strategic orientation and coordinates it with the Supervisory \nBoard.\n In addition, it ensures group\n-wide compliance with legal requirements and an effective risk \nmanagement and internal control system.\n The members of the Management Board are\n appointed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board \nhas set a general age lim\nit of 70 years for the members Management Board. The Management Board \ncurrently consists of three members and has a CEO. Further information on the areas of responsibility \nof \nthe members of the Management Board and their mandates can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements (last chapter). No member of the Management Board has, in aggregate, more than \n\ntwo Supervisory Board mandates in non\n-group listed c\nompanies or comparable functions.\n The members of the Management Board are obliged to\n disclose conflicts of interest to the Chair of the \nSupervisory Board and to the CEO without undue delay and to inform the other members of the \n\nManagement Board accordingly\n. They may only assume sideline activities, in particular supervisory board \nand comparable mandates outside the PUMA Group, with the prior consent of the Supervisory Board. In the \n\npast fiscal year, the members of the Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE did not rep\nort any conflicts of interest.\n The principles of cooperation of the Management Board\n of \nPUMA\n SE are set out in the Rules of Procedure \nfor the Management Board, which can be viewed at \nhttp://about.\nPUMA.com\n under \nÒINVESTOR RELATIONS / \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nÓ. \nSUPERVISORY BOARD\n The German Codetermination Act does not apply to \nPUMA\n SE as a European company. Rather, the size and \ncomposition of the Supervisory Board are determined by the Articles of Association of \nPUMA\n SE and the \nAgreement on the Involvement of Emp\nloyees in \nPUMA\n SE dated July 11, 2011 and its amendment dated \nFebruary 7, 2018. The Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE consists of six members, four of whom are \nshareholder representatives and two of whom are employee representatives. Shareholder representatives\n are being elected\n individually. CVs of the individual Supervisory Board members are available on the \nInternet and are updated regularly. The term of office of the current Supervisory Board members ends at \n\nthe end of the Annual General Meeting which resolv\nes on the discharge of the members of the Supervisory \nBoard for the financial year 2022. Further information on the members of the Supervisory Board, their \nmandates and the term of their membership can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements (last cha\npter). Supervisory Board members who are not a member of any Management Board of \na listed company have not accepted more than five Supervisory Board mandates at non\n-group listed \ncompanies or comparable functions.\n The Supervisory Board app\noints the members of the Management Board and may dismiss them at any time \nfor good cause. Initial appointments are for three years. The Supervisory Board determines the \nremuneration system for the Management Board and reviews it regularly (most recently i\nn 2018). It \ndeterm\nines the individual total compensation of each member of the Board of Management, taking into \naccount the ratio of the Management Board compensation to compensation in the MDAX (horizontal \ncomparison) and to the average compensation of th\ne first management\n level below the Management Board \n(n-1) as well as to the average compensation of all employees (vertical comparison). The relevant workforce \nis the workforce of \nPUMA\n SE. Variable compensation components have a multi\n-year, mainly future\n-r\nelated \nassessment \nbasis. Variable remuneration components that last several years are not paid out prematurely. \nStarting in the 2019 fiscal year, the Supervisory Board has set maximum limits for the individual \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 144 compensation of the Management Board both in t\notal and with rega\nrd to its variable components. It is \nplanned to submit a further developed Management Board remuneration system to the Annual General \nMeeting on May 5, 2021 for approval, which complies with the requirements of the Act Implementing the \nSecond Shareholders\'\n Directive (ARUG II), follows the recommendations of the Code 2020 and is even more \nstrongly aligned with shareholder interests.\n The Supervisory Board monitors and advises the Management Board on the implementation of the strategy. \n\nThe Ma\nnagement Board inf\norms the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively about all \nissues of relevance to the Company relating to strategy, planning, business development, the risk situation, \nrisk management and compliance management system. It\n deals with deviat\nions in the course of business \nfrom the established plans and targets, stating the reasons. The Supervisory Board is involved by the \nManagement Board in decisions of paramount importance for the company or beyond the ordinary course \n\nof bu\nsiness of \nPUMA\n SE and the PUMA Group to which it has rights of approval.\n Together with the Management Board, the Supervisory Board ensures succession planning for future \n\nManagement Board positions and key functions in the PUMA Group. On the basis of group\n-wide talent \nconfer\nences, the Management Board develops recommendations for potential internal successor \n\nappointments, which it discusses regularly with the Supervisory Board. In making its recommendations, the \n\nManagement Board takes into account the Divers\nity Concept adopte\nd by the Supervisory Board for the \ncomposition of the Management Board (see below).\n Between the meetings, the Chair of the Supervisory Board is in regular contact with the CEO in order to \ndiscuss issues of strategy, business development, \nthe risk situation\n, risk management and compliance of \nPUMA. Prior to Supervisory Board meetings, the Management Board or the CEO regularly speaks \n\nseparately to the employee representatives and the shareholder representatives. At the end of the regular \n\nmeet\nings, the Supervis\nory Board always has the opportunity to discuss issues even in the absence of the \nManagement Board. It also makes regular use of this opportunity. The members of the Supervisory Board \n\nalso participate in the meetings by telephone or video\n conference.\n The S\nupervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities. The last time this review took place \nwas at the beginning of 2019. The Supervisory Board was supported by an external law firm that generated \n56 questions that were answ\nered by each of the Supervisory Board members. The results were evaluated \nand implementation measures agreed upon.\n No Supervisory Board member is a member of a governing body of, or exercises advisory functions at, \n\nsignificant competitors of the company; n\no Supervisory Boar\nd member holds any personal relationships \nwith a significant competitor of the company.\n The company supports the Supervisory Board in its training activities, for example by having the Legal \n\nDepartment regularly review changes in the lega\nl framework for th\ne Supervisory Board and address them \nin the meetings. In an onboarding program, new members of the Supervisory Board not only receive \n\ntraining from the legal department on their rights and duties, but also have the opportunity in particul\nar to \nmeet the mem\nbers of the Management Board and other executives for a bilateral exchange on current \nmanagement issues and thus gain an overview of relevant topics of the company.\n The principles of cooperation of the Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE are set\n out in the Rules of Procedure for \nthe Supervisory Board, which can be viewed at \nhttp://about.\nPUMA.com\n under \nÒINVESTOR RELATIONS / \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nÓ. \n! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 145 SHAREHOLDERS AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n The shareholders of \nPUMA\n SE exercise their rights, in partic\nular their informa\ntion and voting rights, at the \nAnnual General Meeting. Each share has one vote. Our shareholders can exercise their voting rights \nthemselves or through a proxy appointed by the company and bound by instructions. All documents and \n\ninformation on the Annual \nGeneral Meeting are available on the website of \nPUMA\n SE. \nAs part of our comprehensive investor relations and public relations work, we are in close contact with our \n\nshareholders. We inform shareholders, financial analysts, shareholders\' \nassociations, the media and the \ninterested public comprehensively and regularly about the situation of the Company and inform them \nwithout undue delay about significant business changes. The Chair of the Supervisory Board is also \nprepared to discuss Superv\nisory Board\n-specific issues with investors within an appropriate framework.\n In addition to other communication channels, we make intensive use of the Company\'s website for our \n\ninvestor relations work. At \nhttp://about.\nPUMA.com\n/en/investor\n-relations\n, all \nmate\nrial information \npublished in the 2020 financial year, including annual, quarterly and half\n-yearly financial reports, press \nreleases, voting rights announcements by major shareholders, presentations and the financial calendar, \ncan be accessed.\n DESCRIPT\nION \nOF THE WORKING PRACTICES AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEES OF THE \nSUPERVISORY BOARD\n The Supervisory Board meets at least every three months. Meetings must also be held if the best interests \nof the Company so require or if a member of the Supervisor\ny Bo\nard requests that the meeting be convened. \nThe Supervisory Board has established three committees to perform its duties and receives regular reports \n\non their work. The principles of cooperation of the Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE and the duties of the \ncomm\nittees are set out in the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board, which can be viewed at \nhttp://about.\nPUMA.com\n under \nÒINVESTOR RELATIONS / CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nÓ. \nThe Personnel Committee consists of three members. The Personnel Committee is respon\nsibl\ne for \nentering into and making changes to the Management Board membersÕ employment contracts and for \n\nestablishing policies for Human Resources and personnel development. The entire Supervisory Board \n\ndecides on issues involving the Management Board memb\nersÕ\n compensation based on recommendations \nfrom the Personnel Committee. The members of the Personnel Committee are Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus \n(Chair), Fiona May and Martin Koeppel.\n The Audit Committee consists of three members. The Chair of the Audit Committee m\nust \nbe an independent \nshareholder representative and must have expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing in accordance \n\nwith Section 100(5) AktG. In particular, the Audit Committee is responsible for the review of the accounting \n\ncomprising particul\narly\n of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report \n(including CSR reporting), interim financial information and the single entity financial statements in \n\naccordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). It is furthermore respons\nible\n for monitoring the \naccounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, the \n\ninternal audit system, compliance and the statutory audit of the financial statements, with particular regard \n\nto the required inde\npendence of the statutory auditors, issuing the audit mandate to the statutory auditors, \ndefining the audit areas of focus, any additional services to be performed by the auditors and the fee \nagreement. The recommendation of the Supervisory Board on the se\nlect\nion of the statutory auditors must \nbe based on a corresponding recommendation by the Audit Committee. Once the Annual General Meeting \nhas appointed the statutory auditors, and the Supervisory Board has issued the audit assignment, the Audit \n\nCommittee s\nhall\n work with the statutory auditors to specify the scope of the audit and the audit areas of \nfocus. The statutory auditors shall attend a meeting to review the annual financial statements and the \n\nconsolidated financial statements and shall report on the \nkey \nfindings of their audit. They shall also inform \nthe Committee about other services they have provided in addition to auditing services and shall confirm \n\ntheir independence. Each month, the Audit Committee shall receive financial data on the PUMA Group,\n whi\nch will allow the tracking of developments in net assets, financial position, results of operations and the \norder books on a continual basis. The Audit Committee shall also deal with issues relating to the balance \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 146 sheet and income statement and shall d\niscu\nss these with the Management Board. In addition, when the \ninternal audit projects are completed, the Audit Committee shall receive the audit reports, which must also \ninclude any actions taken. The members of the Audit Committee are Thore Ohlsson (Chair\n), H\n”loŁse \nTemple\n-Boyer and Bernd Illig.\n The Nominating Committee has three members, who are representatives of the shareholders on the \nSupervisory Board. The Nominating Committee proposes suitable shareholder candidates to the \n\nSupervisory Board for its vo\nting\n recommendations to the Annual General Meeting. The members of the \nNominating Committee are Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus (Chair), H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer and Fiona May.\n The current composition of the committees can further be found in the Notes to the Consolidated\n Fin\nancial \nStatements (last chapter).\n DIVERSITY CONCEPT FOR THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n A) OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n The Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE is composed in such a way that its members as a group possess the \nappropriate know\nledg\ne, skills and professional experience necessary for the proper performance of their \nduties. The composition of the Supervisory Board is primarily determined by appropriate qualification, \ntaking into account diversity and the appropriate involvement of \nwome\nn. Based on Section C.1 of the Code \n2020, the Supervisory Board has set targets for his composition that have been fulfilled. In detail:\n ¥!The members of the Supervisory Board as a group have the experience and knowledge in the field of \nmanagement and/or\n mon\nitoring market\n-oriented companies as well as in the business segments and \nsales markets of PUMA. Details of this are presented under lit. b) of this chapter.\n ¥!A sufficient number of members have strong international backgrounds. This target has been cle\narly\n surpassed simply because of the international origins of Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, \nThore Ohlsson and Fiona May.\n ¥!The Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of independent members. With Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, \nH”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, Th\nore \nOhlsson and Fiona May four out of six members of the Supervisory Board \nare considered independent.\n \nThe Code 2020 does not contain a conclusive definition of independence regarding the shareholder \nrepresentatives in the supervisory board, but rather lis\nts e\nxamples of circumstances that may indicate a \nlack of independence. It is the task of the supervisory board to assess the independence of the \nmembers of the supervisory board on the basis of these indications and evaluate whether a member \n\nhas a personal\n or \nbusiness relationship with the company or its management board that may cause a \nsubstantial \nÐ \nand not merely temporary \nÐ \nconflict of interest. Against this backdrop, PUMAÕs \nSupervisory Board believes that there are currently no specific indications of \nrele\nvant circumstances or \nrelationships for any member of the Supervisory Board that could constitute a material and not merely \n\ntemporary conflict of interest and that would therefore interfere with their independence.\n With regard to Supervisory Board memb\ners \nJean-Fran“ois Palus and H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, the \nSupervisory Board is of the opinion that their functions as Directeur G”n”ral D”l”gu” of Art”mis S.A.S. \n\ndo not impair their independence within the meaning of the Code 2020. Art”mis S.A.S. is not a \n\ncont\nroll\ning shareholder, as Art”mis S.A.S. is neither a majority shareholder nor does it have a de facto \nmajority at the Annual General Meeting.\n With regard to the members of the Supervisory Board Mr. Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus and Mr. Thore Ohlsson, \nthe Supervisory \nBoar\nd believes that the length of their tenure as members of the Supervisory Board, \nwhich each exceeds 12 years, does not interfere with their independence within the meaning of the Code \n\n2020 as it does not give rise to a material conflict of interest. Thi\ns is\n due to the fact that Mr. Palus and \nMr. Ohlsson currently hold positions in the management and supervisory boards of several other \ncompanies. They both have demonstrated a high level of professionalism during their long experience in \nthe management of \nvari\nous companies and the Supervisory Board believes that both would avoid any \ncircumstances that may give rise to conflict of interest. There are no other indications of a conflict of \n\ninterest in Mr. PalusÕ and Mr. OhlssonÕs person.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 147 Jean-Fran“ois Palus as\n the\n Chair of the Supervisory Board, Thore Ohlsson as the Chair of the Audit \nCommittee and Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus as the Chair of the Personnel Committee are all considered \nindependent from the Management Board, the company and a controlling shareholder. No f\norme\nr member of the Management Board is member of the Supervisory Board.\n ¥!Thore Ohlsson, the Chair of the Audit Committee has specific knowledge and experience in applying \naccounting principles and internal control procedures, is familiar with audits and is\n ind\nependent. Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus and H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer also bring this specific knowledge with them. \n ¥!The members have sufficient time to perform his/her mandate in the Supervisory Board. Prior to each \nelection proposal, the Supervisory Board examines \nwhet\nher the candidates concerned are able to \ncomplete the time required for the office.\n ¥!The Supervisory Board prevents potential significant and not only temporary conflicts of interest of its \nmembers by regularly monitoring and critically scrutinizing its\n mem\nbers\' other activities. There were \nno indications of actual conflicts of interest in the 2020 financial year. If a conflict of interest would \n\noccur each member of the Supervisory Board informs the Chair of the Supervisory Board without undue \ndelay.\n ¥!Acc\nordi\nng to Section 1(4) of the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board, Supervisory Board \nmembers may, in principle, not be over 70 years of age and their maximum term of office may not \nexceed three terms. In setting this age limit, the Supervisory Boa\nrd d\neliberately decided against a rigid \nmaximum age limit and in favor of a flexible rule limit that provides the necessary leeway for an \n\nappropriate assessment of the circumstances of the individual case, sufficiently broadly defines the \ncircle of potenti\nal candidates and also allows re\n-election. Thore Ohlsson has reached the statutory age \nlimit. After careful consideration, he was nevertheless proposed by the Supervisory Board for re\n-election in 2018 in order to ensure the necessary continuity after the s\npin\n-off from Kering S.A. in the \nbest interests of the company. All other Supervisory Board members did not reach the standard age \nlimit at the time of their election.\n B) PROFILE OF SKILLS AND EXPERTISE\n The Supervisory Board has determined a competence prof\nile \nfor the entire Board. It stipulates that the \nmembers of the Supervisory Board as a whole must cover the following professional competencies:\n ¥!Managing of large or mid\n-sized international companies (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, \nThore Ohlsso\nn) ¥!Leadership experience in the sporting or luxury goods industry (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, H”loŁse Temple \nBoyer, Thore Ohlsson, Fiona May)\n ¥!International corporate background (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, Thore Ohlsson, Fiona \nMay)\n ¥!Leadership expe\nrien\nce with various disribution channels, including e\n-commerce (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, \nThore Ohlsson)\n ¥!Expertise in building strong international brands (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, Thore \nOhlsson, Fiona May)\n ¥!Marketing, sales and digital know how (J\nean-Fran“ois Palus, H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, Thore Ohlsson)\n ¥!Financial expertise (accounting, treasury, risk management, corporate governance) (Jean\n-Fran“ois \nPalus, Thore Ohlsson, H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer)\n ¥!Expertise in servi\nng on the Administrative or Supervisory \nboards of publicly listed companies (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, Heloise Temple\n-Boyer)\n ¥!Experience with mergers &amp; acquisitions (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus, Thore Ohlsson)\n ¥!Understanding of the industrial constitution law and advocat\ning the interests of the employees (Martin \nKoeppel, Bernd Illig)\n ¥!HR expertise (Jean\n-Fran“ois Palus)\n ¥!IT expertise (Bernd Illig).\n  The Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE is currently composed in such a way that it has the competence profile \nas an overall body.\n \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

The Management Board, for its part, shall set target figures for the proportion \nof women in the two management levels below the Management Board.\n For the Supervisory Board of \nPUMA\n SE, a targ\net figure of 30% has been set for the ta\nrgeted proportion of \nwomen. The implementation period for this target is October 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the six\n-member Supervisory Board included two women, Fiona May and H”loŁse Temple\n-Boyer, resulting i\nn a \nfemale representation of 33%.\n The Supervisory Board has set a target of 20% for the Management Board, provided that \nPUMA\n SE has five \nor more members. The implementation period for this target is October 31, 2021. The Management Board, \n\nwhich consisted o\nf three members as of December 31, 2020 \nincluding Anne\n-Laure Descours, will be \ncomposed of 33% women and 66% men. \n Together with the Supervisory Board, the Management Board has set a target of 25% for the first \n\nmanagement level below the Management Board a\nnd 30% for the second management level b\nelow the \nManagement Board. At Group level, the proportion of women is to increase to 30% for the first management \n\nlevel below the Management Board and to 40% for the second management level. The implementation \n\ndeadli\nne here, too, is October 31, 2021.\n DIVER\nSITY CONCEPT FOR THE MANAGEMENT BOARD\n The Supervisory Board and the Management Board promote an agile, open corporate culture in which the \n\nadvantages of diversity are consciously utilized, and everyone can freely unfold their potential for the best of \nthe \ncompany. PUMA strives to fill Management Board positions and senior management positions primarily \nwith people developed within the company.\n The Supervisory Board\'s decision regarding a particular appointment to the \nManagement Board is always \ntaken in cons\nideration of the company\'s best interests based on the professional and personal suitability of \nthe candidate. It must be ensured that the members of the Management Board as a whole have the \n\nknowledge, skills and exp\nerience required for the best possible f\nulfillment of the tasks of a member of the \nManagement Board of a sporting goods manufacturer such as PUMA. It is not necessary for every member \n\nof the Management Board to reflect the technical requirements laid out i\nn the following. The diversity \nconcept f\nor the Management Board therefore stipulates that gender, internationality, age, educational \nbackground and experience must be taken into account in its composition:\n - \nGender\n PUMA aims to have 20% women on the Management Board by October 31, 2021, provided\n that the Board \nhas five or more Management Board members. In order to achieve this goal, the Management Board \n\nensures that an appropriate proportion of female candidates are \nincluded on the succession lists within the \n\nframework of the internal global mana\ngement structure for the development of junior staff for the \nManagement Board. In the future, the participation of women in the Management Board is to be guaranteed \n\nin the eve\nnt of a necessary replacement, in particular by giving special consideration to w\nomen in various \nequally qualified candidates. Insofar as external candidates are to be appointed, suitably qualified female \ncandidates shall be considered in particular. The s\name applies to the filling of management functions. In \norder to involve women eve\nn more in management functions in the future, PUMA promotes the \ncompatibility of family and career, for example through part\n-time and half\n-day models as well as flexible \nworki\nng hours and the provision of childcare places. With Anne\n-Laure Descours a woman \nis represented on \nthe Management Board. The proportion of women on the Management Board is therefore currently 33%.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 149 - \nInternationality\n PUMA is a globally operating company. \nAn appropriate number of board members must therefore have \ninternational experien\nce either due to their origin or due to their many years of professional experience \nabroad. Notwithstanding the several years of international experience of all board members,\n this goal has \nbeen exceeded simply because of the international origins of Bj¿rn\n Gulden and Anne\n-Laure Descours.\n - \nAge\n The Supervisory Board ensures a balanced age structure in the Management Board. This is important to \nensure the continuity of the Manage\nment Board\'s work and to facilitate smooth succession planning. In \nprinciple, members of the Management Board may not be older than 70 years. All members of the \n\nManagement Board are below the standard age limit.\n - \nTraining and experience background\n With regard to the educational and professional background, the selection of Management \nBoard members \nshould be based on the competencies required in the PUMA Management Board in general as well as for \n\nthe respective Management Board with regard\n to corporate management, strategy development, finance \nand accounting, supply chain, sales and HR.\n The same criteria apply here as were developed for the \ncompetence profile of the Supervisory Board. These competencies do not have to be acquired as part of\n university studies or other educational training, but may also have been acquired in other ways wi\nthin or \noutside PUMA. The members of the board have all the above mentioned competences.\n The current composition of the Management Board implements the diver\nsity concept.\n REMUNERATION REPORT\n The remuneration report prepared by the Management Board and the \nSupervisory Board is published at \nhttps://about.\nPUMA\n.com/en/investor\n-relati\nons/corporate\n-governance\n. \n! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 150 RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT\n PUMA is continuously exposed to opportuniti\nes and risks in the competitive, fast\n-paced and international \nsport and lifestyle industry. The risk strategy is therefore to take business risks in a calcul\nated manner in \norder to implement the corporate strategy with all its opportunities. For this purpo\nse, effective risk and \nopportunity management is required so that opportunities can be recognized and utilized, and risks \nidentified and managed at an early \nstage. We define risks as potential future developments or events that \nmay lead to a negative devia\ntion from targets for the company. Similarly, opportunities are potential future \ndevelopments or events that may result in a positive deviation from targets.\n RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n PUMA takes a conscious and controlled approach to risks in order to achieve\n the company\'s goals. The aim \nof the risk management system is to identify and manage material or even existence\n-threatening risks in \nparticular at an early \nstage in order to support the achievement of the company\'s goals. In addition, \ncompliance with the \nrelated laws, regulations and standards must be ensured, as well as transparency in \nrelation to the risk situation from the perspective of partners such as c\nustomers, suppliers and investors. \nTherefore, PUMA has established an appropriate risk management o\nrganization which is able to identify \nrisks at an early stage and manage them in accordance with the corporate strategy and promote risk \n\nawareness within the\n PUMA Group to facilitate risk\n-based decisions. Opportunity management is not part of \nthe risk mana\ngement system and is the responsibility of operational management teams.\n The Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE bears overall responsibility for the risk management\n system. The \nManagement Board regularly updates the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of \nPUM\nA \nSE. The Risk \nManagement Committee, which consists of the \nPUMA\n SE Management Board and selected managers, is \nresponsible for the design, review and adaptati\non of the risk management system. The risk management \nfunction of the Group Internal Audit, Risk Ma\nnagement &amp; Internal Control Department has been assigned to \nprepare regular risk reports for the Risk Management Committee. Their remit is to enhance operati\nonal \ncoordination of the risk management process and support risk owners. The responsibilities, tas\nks and \nprocesses relating to the risk management system are defined in guidelines. The structure and design of \n\nthe risk management system is as follows:\n !!G.21 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n  ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 151 The risk owners are mainly the managers of the functional areas and the\n managing directors of the \nsubsidiaries. Risks are identified by performing a bottom\n-up analysis within the risk owner\'s area of \nresponsibility and are regul\narly reported to the risk management function and/or the local monitoring \nbodies in structured inte\nrviews or on an ad\n-hoc basis. The risks are assessed using a systematic \nmethodology based on the probability of occurrence, extent of damage and level of con\ntrol using qualitative \ncriteria. Regular risk identification and assessment is carried out by the r\nisk management function every \nsix months with all major functional areas. The risks recorded and assessed are also reviewed in a top\n-down assessment by the R\nisk Management Committee. This ensures that adequate consideration is given \nto interdependencies an\nd the overall risk situation.\n The risk owners are responsible for the operational management of identified risks. Risks can be managed \n\nby avoiding, reducing,\n diversifying or transferring the risk in order to achieve the aimed and acceptable \nresidual risk. \nWithin the reporting process, material or even existence\n-threatening risks are coordinated \nand managed with the Risk Management Committee or the Management Board. The methodology and \n\nstructure of the risk management system are continuously assessed in terms of their effectiveness, and \nadapted or improved when required.\n RISKS\n The following explanations of risk categories are presented based on their \nrelative importance.\n COVID\n-19 PANDEMIC\n The COVID\n-19 pandemic was identified as a new risk in the financial yea\nr 2020 and was considered the most \nsignificant business risk for the PUMA Group. This risk relates to the macroeconomic and social impacts of \nthe \npandemic, caused for example by lockdowns, government\n-ordered closures of retail stores, restrictions \non store\n opening hours, a reduction in store traffic, travel restrictions and social distancing measures, the \ncancellation or postponement of major sporti\nng events, and the exclusion or limitation in the numbers of \nspectators. These consequences have led or may in\n the future lead to declines in revenue and challenges in \nmaintaining business operations. Furthermore, we are faced with new requirements, regula\ntions and \nfurther measures in relation to the health and safety of our employees and customers. The COVID\n-19 pandemic has also had a negative impact on existing sourcing and supply chain risks, as well as default \nrisks of receivables.\n In 2020 the COVID\n-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and dynamically, and the extent and duration of the \nresulting impact on our bus\niness was and remains extremely difficult to predict. However, we assume that \nthe situation created by the COVID\n-19 pandemic will not be long term\n. \nOur aim is to survive this crisis, to stabilize and recover, and then to emerge stronger than before without\n hindering PUMA\'s mid\n-term growth. Our approach is local, as different markets are going through these \nphases at different times. Our main focus i\ns on the health and safety of our employees and customers, \nsecuring the liquidity of the PUMA Group by securin\ng credit lines, maintaining close and reliable \ncooperation with our partners, suppliers and customers, strengthening and expanding the supply chai\nn, \ndigitalizing key business processes and further strengthening our e\n-commerce business. In particular, we \nstrengthened the partnership with our suppliers by cancelling only a very small proportion of orders with \nour suppliers and agreeing extended paymen\nt terms in return. The unused credit lines of the PUMA Group \nserve as a safety reserve for the potential conse\nquences of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. The significant \nincrease in credit lines in the 2020 financial year results from the conclusion of a syndicated \ncredit facility in \nMay of \n!900\n million\n from 11 commercial banks and the Kreditanstalt r Wiederaufbau (KfW) as \nÒbridge \nfinancing\nÓ \nfor a maximum of 2 years. This credit line has not been used so far and could already be reduced \nby \n!700 million\n to only \n!200\n million\n by the end of 2020. For the refinancing and planned redemption of this \nÒbridge financing\nÓ, we secured a new promissory note loan in the amount of \n!250\n million\n with a term of 3 or \n5 years and increased existing syndicated credit lines by \n!450 milli\non. \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 152 SOURCING AND SUPPLY CHAIN\n The majority of PUMA products is produced in selected Asian countries, in particular in Vietnam, China, \nBangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia and India. Production in these countries contains considerable risks for \nus. These risks a\nrise, for example, from changes in sourcing and wage costs, supply bottlenecks for raw \nmaterials or components, and quality issues, as well as from the possibility of overdependence on \n\nindividual manufacturers.\n The portfolio is regularly reviewed and \nadjus\nted to avoid creating a dependence on individual suppliers and \nsourcing markets. Generally, long\n-term master framework agreements are agreed upon to secure the \nrequired production capacities for the future. A quality control process and the direct and\n part\nnership\n-like \ncollaboration with manufacturers should permanently secure the quality and availability of our products. \nSourcing and the supply chain must also react to risks, like changes in duties and tariffs as well as trade \n\nrestrictions. The transport of\n products to the distribution countries is also exposed to the risk of delays and \nfailures by warehouse and logistics service providers.\n We therefore continuously analyze political, economic and legal framework conditions and have further \nenhanced our\n clos\ne cooperation with our logistics partners in order to be able to react to changes in the \nsupply chain early on and to continuously strengthen the supply chain. The collaboration with warehouse \nand logistics service providers is accordingly secured by \nselection processes, consistent contractual terms \nand permanent monitoring of relevant indicators.\n The COVID\n-19 pandemic caused delays and interruptions in sourcing and supply chain operations, \nespecially in the first half of the financial year 2020, and t\nhis led to an increase in the individual risk. To \ncounter this risk, we have intensified our cooperation with suppliers and logistics partners in order to be \nable to react flexibly and solution\n-oriented to the circumstances.\n INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n The ongo\ning digitalization of the business environment exposes PUMA to risks in information technology. \nKey business procedures and processes may be significantly disrupted by the failure of IT systems, and \n\nexternal attacks or wrong behaviour may result in the los\ns of confidential and sensitive data, as well as high \ncosts, loss of revenue and reputational damage.\n To mitigate these risks, we continuously carry out technical and organizational measures and invest in the \nrenewal and security of our IT landscape. IT sy\nstems are regularly checked, maintained and undergo \nsecurity tests. In addition, all employees are continuously sensitized using guidelines, training courses and \n\ninformation campaigns.\n PRODUCT AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n The risk posed by market\n-specific produc\nt influences, in particular the risk of substitutability in the highly \ncompetitive sport and lifestyle market, is decisively countered by the early recognition and taking advantage \nof relevant consumer trends. Only those companies that identify these trend\ns at an early stage will be able \nto gain an edge over their competitors.\n Targeted investments in product design and product development are to ensure that the characteristic \n\nPUMA design of the entire product range is consistent with the overall brand strat\negy (\nÒForever Faster\nÓ), thereby creating a unique level of brand recognition.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 153 BRAND IMAGE\n Brand image and brand desirability are of key importance for us, as consumer behavior can have a negative \neffect on the brand as well as a positive one. Accordingly\n, we have formulated the guiding principle of \nÒWe \nwant to become the fastest sports brand in the world\nÓ \nin order to underline the company\'s long\n-term \ndirection and strategy. The \nÒForever Faster\nÓ \nbrand promise does not just stand for PUMA\'s product range \nas a sports company, but also applies to all company processes.\n We manage brand image risks in particular through cooperation with brand ambassadors who embody the \ncore of the brand and PUMA\'s brand values (\nÒbrave,\nÓ Ò\nconfident,\nÓ Ò\ndetermined\nÓ \nand Òjoyful\nÓ) an\nd have a \nlarge potential for influencing PUMA\'s target group. Therefore, we are strengthening our position as a \n\nsports brand through partnerships with top athletes such as star striker Antoine Griezmann, sprint legend \n\nUsain Bolt, multiple Formula 1 world c\nhampion Sir Lewis Hamilton, pro golfer Rickie Fowler, NBA player \nDanny Green, cricketer Virat Kohli, 400\n-meter hurdles world champion Karsten Warholm, and many other \ntop athletes. In 2020, superstar and professional football player Neymar Jr. also became a\n PUMA brand \nambassador. In football, PUMA has long\n-term sponsorship agreements with top clubs, such as Manchester \nCity, Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan, Olympique Marseille and the Italian national team. PUMA also \n\nintensified its involvement in basketball, ath\nletics, handball and other sports. We reach young trendsetters \n\nvia brand ambassadors and collaborations in the music, movie and fashion scene, such as Jay\n-Z, Meek Mill, \nAdriana Lima, Cara Delevingne, Selena Gomez, Winnie Harlow and Dua Lipa, and also incre\nasingly via \nglobal and local influencers in social networks.\n MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS\n As an internationally operating group, PUMA is exposed to global macroeconomic developments and the \n\nassociated risks having an impact on our sales and sourcing \nmarkets.\n For example, economic \ndevelopments in important sales markets may have an effect on consumer behavior. This can have positive \n\nor negative effects on the planned sales and results. Likewise, political changes, social developments and \n\nenvironmental events can also be reflected in changes in legal and macroeconomic conditions. This may \n\nhappen, for example, in connection with protest movements such as those seen in Hong Kong and other \nparts of the world, or as a consequence of Brexit.\n Overall, we manag\ne these \nchallenges with geographic diversification and the development of alternative \nscenarios for the possible occurrence of serious events. This applies in particular to political developments \nand possible changes in legal framework conditions which are\n continu\nously monitored by PUMA and \nincorporated into appropriate measures, such as the adjustment of the supply chain to the UK due to the \n\nBrexit.\n ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES AND PROJECT RISKS\n PUMA\'s organizational structure with its group headquarters in H\nerzogena\nurach, a central sourcing \norganization and globally positioned distribution companies gives the group a global orientation. This \n\nresults in a risk for us that the flow of goods and information are not sufficiently supported by modern \n\nwarehouse, log\nistics a\nnd IT infrastructure. For this reason, existing business processes must be continually \noptimized and adapted. This is carried out systematically through targeted optimization projects, which are \nplanned and managed centrally by the specialized depa\nrtments.\n CURRENCY RISKS\n As an international company, PUMA is subject to currency risks resulting from the disparity between the \nrespective amounts of currency used on the purchasing and sales sides and from exchange\n-rate \nfluctuations.\n PUMA\'s biggest sourci\nng marke\nt is Asia, where most payments are settled in US dollars (USD), while sales \nof the PUMA Group are mostly invoiced in other currencies. PUMA manages currency risk in accordance \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 154 with internal guidelines. Currency forward contracts are used to hedge e\nxisting \nand future financial \nliabilities in foreign currencies.\n To hedge signed or pending contracts against currency risk, PUMA only concludes currency forward \ncontracts on customary market terms with reputable international financial institutions. As of \nthe end \nof \n\n2020, the net requirements for the 2021 planning period were adequately hedged against currency effects.\n Foreign exchange risks may also arise from intra\n-group loans granted for financing purposes. Currency \nswaps and currency forward transactions are us\ned to hedge currency risks when converting intra\n-group \nloans denominated in foreign currencies into the functional currencies of the group companies (EUR).\n In order to disclose market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effect\ns of hyp\nothetical \nchanges in relevant risk variables on earnings and equity. The periodic effects are determined by relating \n\nthe hypothetical changes caused by the risk variables to the balance of the financial instruments held as of \n\nthe balance sheet date\n. The un\nderlying assumption is that the balance as of the balance sheet date is \nrepresentative for the entire year.\n Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments that are denominated in a \ncurrency that is not the functional currency\n and are monetary in nature. Differences resulting from the \nconversion of the individual financial statements to the group currency are not taken into account. All non\n-functional currencies in which PUMA employs financial instruments are generally \nconsider\ned to be relevant \nrisk variables.\n Currency sensitivity analysis are based on the following assumptions: Material original monetary financial \ninstruments (cash and cash equivalents, receivables, interest\n-bearing and non\n-interest\n-bearing liabilities)\n are eit\nher denominated in the functional currency or are transferred into the functional currency using \ncurrency forward transactions.\n Currency forward contracts used to hedge against payment fluctuations caused by exchange rates are part \nof an effective \ncash-flow hedging relationship pursuant to IAS 39. Changes in the exchange rate of the \ncurrencies underlying these contracts have an effect on the hedge reserve in equity and the fair value of \n\nthese hedging contracts.\n DEFAULT RISKS\n PUMA\'s business \nactivities resul\nt in the company being exposed to default risk that is managed by \ncontinuously monitoring outstanding receivables and recognizing impairment losses, where appropriate. \nThe default risk is limited where possible by credit insurance and the m\naximum default r\nisk is reflected by \nthe carrying amounts of the financial assets recognized on the balance sheet. Due to the negative \n\nmacroeconomic effects of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, the default risk of receivables increased in the financial \nyear 2020. As a\n result, value a\ndjustments to receivables increased compared to the previous year. \nFurthermore, default risks to a lesser extent arise from the counterparty\'s other contractual financial \n\nobligations such as bank deposits and derivative financial instrument\ns. LIQUIDITY RIS\nK \nPUMA continually analysis short\n-term capital requirements through rolling cash flow planning at the level \nof the individual companies in coordination with the central Treasury department. PUMA maintains a \nliquidity reserve, for example, i\nn the form of ca\nsh and confirmed credit facilities in order to ensure the \ncompany\'s solvency, financial flexibility and a strategic liquidity buffer. In this respect, as of December 31, \n2020, the PUMA Group had unused credit lines totaling \n!1,372.7\n million\n. \nMedium and lon\ng-\nterm funding requirements that cannot be directly covered by net cash from operating \nactivities are financed by taking out medium and long\n-term loans. For this purpose, various promissory \nnote loans were issued in July 2018, December 2019\n and December 20\n20, each in several tranches with a \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 155 fixed and a variable coupon and each with different residual terms. The utilized promissory note loans total \n!245.0\n million\n as at December 31, 2020 and have a remaining term of between one and five years.\n DISTRIBUTION ST\nRUCTURE\n PUMA utilizes various distribution channels, such as the traditional wholesale business with our retail \n\npartners and the PUMA\n-owned retail and e\n-commerce business to reduce its dependency on individual \ndistribution channels. The who\nlesale business \nis defined by strong partnerships and represents the largest \nrevenue share overall. The company\'s own retail and e\n-commerce business is intended to ensure a higher \ngross profit margin, better control on distribution and presentation of PUMA\n products exclus\nively in the \ndesired brand environment.\n In the wholesale business, up\n-and-coming retailers, including those offering their own brands, and \ncompetitors pose the risk of intensified competition for consumers and market shares. Consumer purcha\nse \nbehavior is a\nlso changing, focusing more on e\n-commerce and a combination of stationary and digital trade. \nThis requires continuous adjustment of the distribution structure. Distribution through the company\'s own \n\nretail stores and e\n-commerce channels is,\n however, also a\nssociated with various risks for us. These include \nthe necessary investments in expansion and infrastructure, setting up and refurbishing stores, higher fixed \n\ncosts and leases with long\n-term lease obligations. This can have an adverse impact on profitability in case \nof a business decline.\n In order to avoid risks, we carry out permanent monitoring of distribution channels and regular reporting by \n\nthe Controlling and specialized departments. A detailed location and profitability analysis is ca\nrried out in \nour distribution channels before making any investment decision. The company\'s reporting and controlling \nsystem allows us to detect negative trends early on, and to take the countermeasures required to manage \n\nindividual stores. In e\n-commerce, \nglobal activitie\ns are harmonized and investments in the IT platform are \nmade to further optimize purchase transaction settlement and further improve the shopping experience for \n\nconsumers.\n COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS\n Counterfeit products can undermine consumer con\nfidence in the b\nrand and damage PUMA\'s brand image. \nFighting brand piracy is therefore a high priority for us. The PUMA team responsible for the protection of \nintellectual property not only ensures that we have a strong global portfolio of property rights,\n such as \nbrands,\n designs and patents, but also works closely with customs and police forces and provides input \nregarding the implementation of effective legislation to protect intellectual property.\n REPORTING IN THE MEDIA\n A negative media report about PUMA\n, such as a prod\nuct recall, the infringement of laws or internal or \nexternal requirements, and exposure on social media in this age of \nÒfake news\nÓ, as well as workforce \ndiversity and tolerance, can also cause significant damage to brand image and ultimatel\ny result in the \nloss \nof sales and profit, regardless of whether these events actually happened or were just rumors.\n We encounter this risk via careful press, social media and public relations work and through monitoring of \nthe press and social media enviro\nnment. This is m\nanaged from the group headquarters in Herzogenaurach, \nGermany, and the subsidiary in the U.S. In addition, PUMA continuously seeks an open dialog with key \nexternal stakeholders, such as suppliers, NGOs and industry initiatives, and has inst\nitutionalized this as \npart of regularly held \nÒSustainability Stakeholder Meetings.\nÓ \nSUSTAINABILITY\n Sustainability topics are highly important in sourcing, but also throughout the entire value chain. There is a \nrisk that suppliers will violate core labor st\nandards of ILO (\nInternational Labour Organization), not comply \nwith environmental standards or use hazardous chemicals in production. This would violate our \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 156 requirements to suppliers and also lead to negative reporting and potentially to a loss of revenue.\n Adherence to ap\nplicable standards is ensured through regular audits of supplier companies.\n In addition, climate change and the resulting increase in customer requirements with regard to \nsustainability are leading to a stronger ecological focus in our prod\nuct range, both \nat our own locations and \nalong the production and supply chain. A more efficient use of resources and reduction of greenhouse gas \n\nemissions as well as the increased use of sustainable production materials are crucial parts of our \n\nsustainabi\nlity strategy.\n PUMA\'s sustainability report (the Non\n-financial Report) for the financial year 2020 will be available by April \n30, 2021 at the latest on the following page of our website: \nhttps://about.\nPUMA.com\n/en/investor\n-relations/financial\n-reports\n. Furth\nermore, importan\nt sustainability information can always be found in the \nSustainability section on PUMA\'s website: \nhttp://about.\nPUMA.com\n/en/sustainability\n PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT\n The creative potential, commitment and performance of PUMA employees are \nimportant factors for \nsuccessful business development. We encourage independent thinking and action, which are key in an open \ncorporate culture with flat hierarchies. Our human resources strategy seeks to ensure this successful \n\nphilosophy on a long\n-term an\nd sustainable basis. To \nachieve this goal, a control process is in place to detect \nand assess human\n-resource risks. Accordingly, special attention has been paid to talent management, \nidentifying key positions and high\n-potential individuals, and optimizing \ntalent placement and suc\ncession \nplanning. We have also instituted additional national and global regulations and guidelines to ensure \n\ncompliance with legal provisions and safeguard the health and safety of our employees. We will continue to \nmake targeted i\nnvestments in the human\n-resource needs of particular functions or regions in order to \nmeet the future requirements of our corporate strategy.\n LEGAL RISKS\n As an internationally operating group, PUMA is exposed to various legal risks. These include contractu\nal \nrisks or risks that a\n third party could assert claims and litigation for infringement of its trademark rights, \npatent rights or other rights. The continuous monitoring of contractual obligations and the integration of \ninternal and external legal experts\n in contractual matters is to ensure that any legal risks are avoided.\n COMPLIANCE RISKS\n PUMA is exposed to the risk that employees violate laws, directives and company standards (compliance \nviolations). These risks, such as theft, fraud, breach of trust, e\nmbezzlement and corrupti\non, as well as \ndeliberate misrepresentations in financial reporting, may lead to significant monetary and reputational \n\ndamage. Therefore, we use various tools to manage these risks. This includes an integrated compliance \nmanagement \nsystem, the internal con\ntrol system, group controlling and the internal audit department. As \npart of the compliance management system, awareness measures are carried out regarding critical \ncompliance topics, such as corruption prevention and cartel law, an\nd corresponding guidelin\nes and a global \n\nnetwork of compliance officers are introduced in the group. PUMA employees also have access to an \n\nwhistleblowing system for reporting unethical behavior.\n TAX RISKS\n In an international business environment, applicable\n tax regulations must be\n observed. By means of \nappropriate internal rules of conduct, employees are required to comply with and adhere to the relevant tax \n\nregulations. In addition to compliance with national tax regulations to which the individual group co\nmpanies \nare subject, the\nre are increasing risks in the course of intra\n-group transfer pricing, which must be applied \nfor various internal business transactions in accordance with the arm\'s length principle between individual \n\ngroup companies. In all tax are\nas PUMA has taken adequa\nte precautions with internal and external tax \nexperts in order to comply with the relevant tax regulations, but also to be able to react to changes in the \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 157 constantly changing tax environment. For the group\n-internal transfer prices a\n corresponding \ndocumenta\ntion exists, which was prepared according to international and national requirements and \nstandards. There are guidelines and specifications for determining transfer prices for intra\n-group \ntransactions that are customary for foreign \ncompanies, which comply \nwith the applicable procedural rules \nand are binding on the employees acting on behalf of the group. By means of internal tax reporting, external \nand internal tax experts are able to control and monitor tax developments at PUMA on a\nn ongoing basis. \nBoth th\ne Management Board and the Supervisory Board are continuously informed about tax developments \n\nat PUMA in order to identify and avoid tax risks as early as possible.\n INTEREST\n-RATE RISKS\n At PUMA, changes in interest rates do not have \na significant impact on \ninterest rate sensitivity and therefore \ndo not require the use of interest rate hedging instruments.\n RISK OVERVIEW TABLE\n The following table summarizes the risk categories described above based on their relative importance and \nany changes during the year:\n !!T.10 \nOVERVIEW OF RISK CATEGORIES \n(Order according to relative importance)\n  Classification of \nrisk category\n Description\n Change \ncompared to \nprevious year\n COVID\n-19 Pandemic\n Strategic\n E.g. store closures, supply problems, \nemployee and customer health\n New\n Sou\nrcing and Supply Chain\n Operational\n E.g. sourcing costs, supply bottlenecks, \nquality issues\n (COVID\n-19) \n" Information Technology\n Operational\n E.g. cyberattacks, system failures \n - Product and Market \nEnvironment\n Strategic\n E.g. trends, customer requirements\n - Brand Image\n Strategic\n E.g. brand heat, brand ambassadors\n - Macroeconomic Developments\n Strategic\n E.g. economic development, political \nsituation, legal framework conditions\n - Organizational Challenges and Project \nRisks\n Strategic\n E.g.

Combined Management Report\n 158 OPPORTUNITIES\n Opportunities should be identified by PUMA at an early stage, assessed and \n- \nwhere possible \n- \nused. Due to \nthe close \nconnection to \nthe relevant goals, identified opportunities are incorporated into planning by \nControlling. Operational management teams in the respective regions, markets and departments are \nresponsible for opportunity management. The following key opportun\nity categories\n were identified for the \nplanning period and beyond.\n In terms of macroeconomic conditions, the effects of the COVID\n-19 pandemic are currently seen as \nstrengthening of the sport and lifestyle sector. If PUMA succeeds in emerging stronger from \nthe crisis \nwit\nhout hindering mid\n-term growth potential, the company has an opportunity to increase its market share. \nAt a time when working from home is increasing and indoor and team sports are limited, items such as \n\nrunning, fitness, golf and lounge prod\nucts have beco\nme more relevant. The product range in these areas is \ntherefore being expanded and improved. Furthermore, postponed sporting events such as the Olympic \nGames and the European Football Championship, as well as the easing of restrictions, may l\nead to a further \nincrease in the consumption of sporting goods or catch\n-up effects. In addition, there are opportunities in \nthe regulatory environment, for example in connection with a reduction in trade restrictions and \n\nprotectionism, particularly in conn\nection with the outcome of the US election.\n In terms of the distribution structure, the COVID\n-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the growth of \nthe e\n-commerce business. Stronger partnerships in the wholesale business also offer opportunities for \nfutu\nre business de\nvelopment. New sales formats and improvements to the shopping experience in our own \nretail stores can also open up positive business prospects. In this area, new, state\n-of-the\n-art multi\n-channel \ndistribution centers in key markets will also support the furt\nher optimization of delivery capacity in the \nfuture.\n In information technology, improved, tailored communication with customers via digital channels and new \n\nways of presenting products, for example, offer opportunities. In addition, new or mo\nre efficient processes \nmay add value or result in cost optimization. Here, too, the COVID\n-19 pandemic has accelerated the \ndigitalization of important business processes, for example with regard to product design and the \n\npurchasing process for our wholesale\n customers. It\n has also contributed to the further development of the \nIT environment.\n With end customers paying more attention to sustainability, there is an opportunity to make further \n\nprogress with existing PUMA activities and improve communication in th\nis area, which\n could increase \ndemand for sustainable products.\n Furthermore, in the area of finance, for example, favorable exchange rate developments offer the \n\nopportunity to positively influence the group\'s financial results.\n OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK AND OPPORTUN\nITY SITUATION\n The assessment of the overall risk situation of the Group and \nPUMA\n SE is the result of a consolidated view \nof the risk and opportunity categories described above. Compared to what was presented in our 2019 \n\nAnnual Report, our \nassessment of PUM\nA\'s overall risk situation has been expanded mainly to account for \nthe effects of the COVID\n-19 pandemic described above, which is currently the biggest challenge. The \nManagement Board is currently not aware of any significant risks that, e\nither individuall\ny or in combination \n\nwith other risks, could jeopardize the continued existence of the Group and \nPUMA\n SE. \nHowever, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the future factors that are currently unknown to us or \n\nthat we currently assess as \nimmaterial might influence the continued existence of the Group and \nPUMA\n SE and its consolidated companies. Also due to the extremely solid balance sheet structure and equity ratio, as \nwell as the strong liquidity position and the positive business outlook\n, the Management \nBoard does not see \nany significant threat to the continued existence of the PUMA Group and \nPUMA\n SE. \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 159 MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n AS IT RELATES TO THE GROUP\'S ACCOUNTING PROCESS\n The Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of the annual financial \nstatements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report of \nPUMA\n SE. The \nconsolidated financial statements were prepared in \naccordance with the International Financia\nl Reporting \nStandards that apply in the EU, the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the German \nStock Corporation Act (AktG) and the German SE Implementation Act (SEAG). Certain disclosures and \namounts\n are based on current estimates by the Management Board and the management.\n The Management Board is responsible for maintaining and regularly monitoring a suitable internal control \n\nand risk management system covering the consolidated financial statements a\nnd the disclosures in the \ncombined managem\nent report. This control and risk management system is designed to ensure the \ncompliance and reliability of the internal and external accounting records, the presentation and accuracy of \nthe consolidated financial \nstatements, and the combined management re\nport and the disclosures contained \ntherein. It is based on a series of process\n-integrated monitoring steps and encompasses the measures \nnecessary to accomplish these, such as internal instructions, organizational and authorization guidelines, \nthe relevant \ncompany guidelines (e.g. \nÒAnti\n-Corruption/Anti\n-Bribery,\nÓ Ò\nCyber Fraud\nÓ), a clear separation of \nfunctions within the Group and the dual\n-control principle. The adequacy and operating effectiveness of \nthese measures a\nre regularly reviewed by the Group Interna\nl Audit, Risk Management &amp; Internal Control \nDepartment.\n For monthly financial reporting and consolidation, PUMA has a group\n-wide reporting and controlling \nsystem that allows to regularly and promptly detect deviati\nons from projected figures and accounting \nirregularities and, where necessary, to take countermeasures.\n The risk management system can regularly, as well as on an ad\n-hoc basis, identify events that could affect \nthe company\'s economic performance and its ac\ncounting process so that it can analyze an\nd evaluate the \nresulting risks and take the necessary actions to counter them.\n In preparing the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, it is also \n\nsometimes necessary to make assumptio\nns and estimates that are based on the inf\normation available on \nthe balance sheet date and which will affect the reported amounts and recognition of assets and liabilities, \n\nincome and expenses, contingent liabilities, and other data that must be reported, \nas well as how these are \npresented.\n The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board meets on a regular basis with the independent statutory \n\nauditors, the Management Board and the Group Internal Audit, Risk Management &amp; Internal Control \n\nDepartment to discuss t\nhe results of the internal audits and statutory audits with reference to the internal \ncontrol and risk management system as it relates to the accounting process. At the annual meeting on the \n\nfinancial statements, the auditor reports to the Audit Committee \nand to the Supervisory Board on the \nresult\ns of the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 160 In addition to the measures described, the Group Internal Audit, Risk Management &amp; Internal Control \nDepartment carries out so\n-called Internal Co\nntrol Self\n-Assessments (ICSA) for all esse\nntial business \nprocesses across the Group. In this way, the internal control system is expanded beyond the accounting \n\nprocess, in line with the framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\n Commission (COSO), to support the objecti\nves of ensuring proper financial reporting, improving the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the processes, and ensuring compliance with legal framework conditions. \n\nThe use of a standardized software system (GRC tool)\n is intended to ensure the systematic and \nuniform \nimplementation of ICSA across the entire company. In these, process owners evaluate the existing control \nframework based on internal and external guidelines and best\n-practice standards. The objective is to \ncontinuously improve the internal control \nsystem and to identify specific risks and potential for \nimprovement in the control environment at process level in order to define appropriate recommendations \nfor action and enable these to be implemented timely by\n the process owners. The results of the IC\nSA are \nreported to the Audit Committee and the statutory auditors and are used specifically by the Group Internal \n\nAudit, Risk Management &amp; Internal Control Department in risk\n-oriented audit planning.\n ! \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 161 OUTLOOK REPORT\n GLOBAL ECONOMY\n Following the historic e\nconomic downturn resulting from the global COVID\n-19 pandemic in 2020, experts at \nthe Kiel Institute for the World Economy (ifw Kiel) expect global gross domestic product (GDP) to rise \nrobustly by 6.1% in 2021 (wint\ner forecast dated December 16, 2020). The \nstrong recovery of the global \neconomy is based on the assumption that the population will become increasingly vaccinated in 2021 and \nthat the risks of infection will be sustainably reduced, leading to a progressive\n normalization of economic \nconditions. Pro\nvided that vaccination programs are implemented quickly and comprehensively, this should \nhelp to reduce economic uncertainty and increasing household consumption spending, supported by low \n\ninterest rates and income\n-supporting fiscal policies. However, the \ngreatest risks to economic development \nstems from uncertainty about the future course of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, should vaccination of the \npopulation turn out to be more difficult or take longer than expected. At th\ne same time, the normalization \nprocess cou\nld also take place more quickly if conditions are favorable, leading to greater economic \nmomentum.\n SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY\n Provided that the continued course of the COVID\n-19 pandemic does not result in a renewed si\ngnificant \nnegative impact on the macroecon\nomic conditions, we expect the sporting goods industry to grow in 2021. \nWe expect demand for sporting goods to increase in 2021 as the trend toward increased sports activities \n\nand healthier lifestyles continues and\n becomes even more significant as a result\n of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. \nThis applies equally to the increasing popularity of athletic footwear and leisure/athletic apparel as an \n\nintegral part of everyday fashion (ÒathleisureÓ). We also expect that major sporting events postponed to \n2021 - \nthe Tokyo S\nummer Olympics and the European Football Championship \n- \nwill also help to support \ngrowth in the sporting goods industry.\n OUTLOOK 2021\n Our sales and profitability rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2020 afte\nr a very weak second quarter, \nwhich was se\nverely impacted by the COVID\n-19 pandemic. Given this strong rebound, we anticipated that \n2021 would become what 2020 was initially supposed to be: a year characterized by double\n-digit sales \ngrowth compared to the 2\n019 baseline and a strong improvement in o\nur operating result (EBIT) driven by a \nslight improvement in our gross profit margin and operational leverage (2019 EBIT: \n!440.2\n million\n). However, as we enter the year 2021 more than 50% of the retail stores that \nare selling our products in \nEurope are cur\nrently closed due to various lockdown measures. As the number of COVID\n-19 cases \ncontinues to rise around the world, more and more markets are closing down retail stores in compliance \nwith local restrictions and sev\neral governments have already extended the\nir lockdowns into February or \neven March. By consequence, a part of our business in 2021 will be once again negatively impacted by the \n\nCOVID\n-19 pandemic despite a strong orderbook and high demand from our retail pa\nrtners and customers. \nWe will continue to \nmitigate the consequences of the COVID\n-19 pandemic wherever possible but foresee a \nnegative impact on our business especially in the first half of 2021.\n We currently believe that the first quarter and also the begi\nnning of the second quarter will be heavil\ny impacted but that we will see a recovery until the end of the second quarter and strong improvements \n\nthroughout the third and fourth quarter. Given that vaccination campaigns are already under way in almost \n\nall parts of the world, we remain confident especially for the second half of 2021. For the full year 2021 we \nconsequently expect at least a moderate increase in sales in constant currency (2020: \n!5,234.4\n million\n) and \nthat both our operating result (EBIT 2020: \n!209.2\n million\n) and net earnings (2020: \n!78.9\n million\n) will show a \n\n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Combined Management Report\n 162 significant improvement compared to 2020. The development of our gross profit margin and our OPEX\n-ratio \nfor 2021 will depend on the degree and duration of the negative impact of the COVID\n-1\n9 pandemic on our \nsales.\n Our quick recover\ny in the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020 and our strong \norderbook for the year 2021 combined with very good feedback from retailers and customers around the \nworld make us confident for\n the mid\n-term success and growth of PUMA.\n INVESTMENTS\n Investments in fixed assets of around \n!200\n million\n are planned for 2021. The majority of these investments \nwill be in infrastructure in order to create the operating conditions required for the planned \nlong\n-term \ngrowth. The investments mainly c\noncern own distribution and logistics centers and further investments in \nthe expansion and modernization of the GroupÕs own retail stores.\n FOUNDATION FOR LONG\n-TERM GROWTH\n The Management Board and the \nSupervisory Board have set long\n-term strategic prioritie\ns. Action plans are \nbeing implemented in a targeted and value\n-oriented manner. We believe that the corporate strategy \nÒForever FasterÓ provides the basis for medium\n- \nand long\n-term positive development\n. \nHerzogenaurach, February 2, 2021\n  The Management Boa\nrd Gulden\n L−mmermann\n Descours\n  \n  Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

Consolidated Financial Statements\n NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED \n FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n 1. GENERAL Under the PUMA and Cobra Golf brand names, \nPUMA\n SE and its subsidiaries are engaged in the \ndevelopment and sale of a broad range of sports and sports lifestyle products, including footwear, apparel \nand accessories. The company is a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea/SE) and parent \n\ncompany of the PUMA Group; its register\ned office is on PUMA WAY 1, 91074 Herzogenaurach, Germany. The \ncompetent registry court is in Frth (Bavaria), the register number is HRB 13085.\n The consolidated financial statements of \nPUMA\n SE and its subsidiaries (hereinafter shortly referred to as \nthe Ò\nGroupÓ or ÒPUMAÓ) were prepared in accordance with the ÒInternational Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS)Ó accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as they are to \n\nbe applied in the EU, and the supplementary accou\nnting principles to be applied in accordance with Section \n\n315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The IASB standards and interpretations, as they are to be \n\napplied in the EU, which are mandatory for financial years as of January 1, 2020, have been ap\nplied.\n The items contained in the financial statements of the individual Group companies are measured based on \n\nthe currency that corresponds to the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company \noperates. The consolidated financial state\nments are prepared in euros (EUR or \n!). The presentation of \namounts in\n million\ns of euros with one decimal place may lead to rounding differences since the calculation \nof individual items is based on figures presented in thousands.\n The cost of sales method \nis used for the income statement.\n The following new and amended standards and interpretations have been used for the first time in the \ncurrent financial year:\n !!T.06\n NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n Standard\n Title\n First\n-time adoption in the \n current financial year\n  Amendments to IFRS 16\n COVID\n-19 related Rent Concessions\n Amendments to Conceptual Framework\n Updated Conceptual Framework\n Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8\n Definition of Material\n Amendments to IFRS 3\n Definition of a Business\n Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7\n Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 1)\n    ! \n  173 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n The standards and interpretations used for the first time as of January 1, 2020 had the following effects on \nthe consolidated financial statements:\n AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 16 \nCOVID\n-19-RELATED RENT CONCESSIONS\n The amendments to IFRS 16 in respect of COVID\n-19-related rent concessions enable lessees to make use \nof a practical recognition exemption. This means that PUMA, as a lessee, may waive the evaluation of \nwhether COVID\n-19-rel\nated rent concessions \nÐ \ne.g. a deferral of or exemption from rent/lease payments for \na specific period of time \nÐ \nconstitute lease modifications as defined in IFRS 16. PUMA has decided to make \nuse of this elective right for all rent concessions that fall wi\nthin the scope of this measure and to apply the \nrecognition exemption retroactively from January 1, 2020.\n This practical recognition exemption applies only to rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the \nCOVID\n-19 pandemic and that meet the followi\nng requirements cumulatively:\n (a) The change to the lease payments may only result in a change to the consideration that is \n\nsubstantively equal to or less than the consideration before the rent concessions were granted. \n\nAccordingly, a (net) increase to the\n consideration would not fall within the scope of the practical \nrecognition exemption.\n b) The provision may only be exercised for payments that would have been due on or before June 30, \n\n2021 pursuant to the original contractual agreement.\n c) The changes mu\nst not be accompanied by any additional material changes to the terms and \nconditions of the contract. For example, a three\n-month suspension of lease payments before June 30, \n2021, combined with a three\n-month lease extension at the end of the agreement term\n under practically \nthe same conditions, does not constitute a material change to the contractual terms or conditions.\n Where the above conditions are met, PUMA may represent the rent concessions on the balance sheet as if \n\nthey were variable lease payments a\nnd recognize them in the income statement in the period in which the \nrent concessions were granted. In the case of final exempted lease payments, it must be checked whether \n\nthe lease liability is to be written off in accordance with the provisions of IFRS \n9 ÒFinancial Instruments.Ó \nThis simplifies the recognition of rent concessions on the balance sheet, as it is no longer necessary to \ncheck whether the conditions for a contractual modification apply and any changes must not be recognized \nas a contractual modification in the balance sheet.\n As a result of this practical recognition exemption, in the financial year 2020 PUMA recognized \n\n!13.7\n million\n in rent concessions as variable lease payments in the income statement. This also led to a \nreversal of lease liabilities in almost the same amount. \nFurthermore, lease payments were deferred and, \n\nfor some contracts, the underlying lease term was extended b\ny a period of up to three months. In these \ncases, no adjustment was made to the amount of lease liabilities.\n The information regarding leases in financial year 2020 is presented in chapter 10.\n ! \n  174 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n CHANGES IN OTHER STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n The amendments to the other standards and interpretations described below, which were to be initially \nadopted as of January 1, 2020, did not affect the PUMA consolidated financial statements.\n The amendments concern the revision of the IFRS Conceptual Framework\n, which includes revised \ndefinitions of assets and liabilities, along with new guidelines on measurement and write\n-off, reporting and \ndisclosure. Alongside the revised Conceptual Framework, amendments to references to the conceptual \n\nframework in some stand\nards were also issued.\n Changes to IAS 1 and IAS 8 (Definition of Material) further clarify the definition of ÒmaterialÓ and align the \nvarious definitions used in the Conceptual Framework and in the standards themselves.\n The narrowly defined amendments to I\nFRS 3 (Definition of a Business) aim to clarify whether an entity has \nacquired a business or a group of assets. The amendments are applicable to all business combinations and \nasset acquisitions for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2020.\n The interest rate benchmark reform (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) concerns specific \n\nrequirements for the accounting of hedge relationships in interest rate hedge deals. \nAs PUMA does not use \ninterest rate hedging instruments, this amendment has \nno effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n ! \n  175 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

Consolidated Financial Statements\n 2. SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION, ACCOUNTING AND VALUATION PRINCIPLES \nCONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES\n The consolidated financial statements were prepared as of December 31, 2020, the reporting date of the \nannual financial statements of the \nPUMA\n SE parent company, on the basis of uniform accounting and \nvaluation principles according\n to IFRS, as applied in the EU.\n Subsidiaries are companies in which the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct \nthe relevant activities. The main activities are those that have a significant influence on the profitability of \n\nthe company. Control is therefore considered to exist if the Group is exposed to variable returns from its \nrelationship with a company and has the power to govern those returns through its control of the relevant \nactivities. As a rule, control is based on PU\nMAÕs direct or indirect majority of the voting rights. Consolidation \nbegins at the point in time from which control is possible. It ends when this no longer exists.\n The recognition of business combinations is based on the acquisition method. The assets, debts and \ncontingent liabilities that can be identified as part of a business combination are generally stated at their \n\nfair value as of the acquisition date, regardless of the size of non\n-controlling interests. At the time of the \nacquisition, there is a separately exercisable right to vote on whether the interests of the non\n-controlling \nshareholders are valued at fair value or at proportional net asset value.\n The surplus of the consideration transferred that exceeds the GroupÕs share in the net assets stated\n at fair \nvalue is reported as goodwill. If the consideration transferred is lower than the amount of the net assets \n\nstated at fair value, the difference is reported directly in the income statement.\n  \nBased on the structure of agreements with shareholders h\nolding non\n-controlling interests in specific Group \ncompanies, PUMA is the economic owner when it has a majority stake. The companies are fully included in \nthe consolidated financial statements and, therefore, non\n-controlling interests are not disclosed. Th\ne present value of the capital shares attributable to the non\n-controlling shareholders and the present value \nof the residual purchase prices expected due to corporate performance are included in the capital \nconsolidation as acquisition costs for the holdin\ngs. The costs directly attributable to the purchase and later \n\ndifferences of the present values of the expected residual purchase prices are recognized in the income \n\nstatement in accordance with IFRS 3.\n With respect to the remaining controlling interests, \nlosses attributable to non\n-controlling interests are \nallocated to the latter even if this results in a negative balance in non\n-controlling interests.\n Receivables within the Group are offset against internal liabilities. As a general rule, any \nset-off differences \narising from exchange rate fluctuations are recognized in the income statement to the extent that they \n\naccrued during the reporting period. If receivables and liabilities are long\n-term and capital\n-replacing in \nnature, the currency diffe\nrence is recognized directly in equity and under Other Comprehensive Income.\n In the course of the expense and income consolidation, inter\n-company sales and intra\n-group income are \noffset against the expenses attributable to them. \nInterim profits not yet rea\nlized within the Group as well as \nintra\n-group investment income are eliminated.\n ! \n  177 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n GROUP OF CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES\n In addition to \nPUMA\n SE, \nthe consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries in which \nPUMA\n SE directly or indirectly holds existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities. At \npresent, control of all Group companies is based on a direc\nt or indirect majority of voting rights.\n Associated companies are generally accounted for in the Group using the equity method. As of December \n\n31, 2020, the Group does not comprise any associated companies.\n The changes in the number of Group companies (inc\nluding the parent company \nPUMA\n SE ) in the financial \nyear 2020 were as follows:\n !!T.08 The addition to the group of consolidated companies relates to the formation of stichd NA, Inc., USA.\n The disposal in the group of consolidated companies relates to the liquidation of PUMA Racing Ltd., Malta.\n The changes in the group of \nconsolidated companies did not have a significant effect on the net assets, \nfinancial position and results of operations.\n  As of\n 12/31/2019\n 102 Formation of companies\n  1 Disposal of companies\n  1 As of\n 12/31/2020\n 102    \n  178 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

Consolidated Financia\nl Statements\n CURRENCY CONVERSION\n In general, monetary items in foreign currencies are converted in the individual financial statements of the \nGroup companies at the exchange rate valid on the balance sheet date. Any resulting currency gains and \nlosses are immediately recognized in the inco\nme statement. Non\n-monetary items are converted at \nhistorical acquisition and manufacturing costs.\n The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency of which is not the euro, have been \n\nconverted to euros at the average exchange rat\nes valid on the balance sheet date. Expenses and income \nhave been converted at the annual average exchange rates. Any differences resulting from the currency \nconversion of net assets relative to exchange rates that had changed in comparison with the previo\nus year \nwere adjusted against equity.\n The significant conversion rates per euro are as follows:\n !!T.10  2020 2019 \nCurrency\n Reporting date \n exchange rate\n Average exchange rate\n Reporting date \n exchange rate\n Average exchange rate\n USD\n 1.2271\n 1.1422\n 1.1234\n 1.1195\n CNY\n 8.0225\n 7.8747\n 7.8205\n 7.7355\n JPY\n 126.4900\n 121.8458\n 121.9400\n 122.0058\n GBP 0.8990\n 0.8897\n 0.8508\n 0.8778\n      The currency area Argentina has been in a hyperinflationary environment since 2018. The effects on the \nconsolidated financial statements were analyzed in accordance with IAS 29 and IAS 21.42. The application of \n\nthe aforementioned standards would have resulted in an increase in assets as of December 31, 2020 of \n\n!14.7\n million\n (mainly property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and inventories) and an adjustment \nof equity of \n!14.7\n million\n. Furthermore, the operating result (EBIT) would have decreased by \n!4.4\n million\n. The effects were considered insignificant and did not lead to an adjustment in the context of the group \naccounting.\n ! \n  184 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n ACCOUNTING AND VALUATION PRINCIPLES\n FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n Financial instruments are classified and recognized in accordance w\nith IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9, the \nsubsequent measurement of financial instruments is carried out according to the classification at \nÒamortized costÓ (AC), at Òfair value through profit or lossÓ (FVPL) or at Òfair value through other \n\ncomprehensive incomeÓ (FVOC\nI). The classification is based on two criteria: the GroupÕs business model for \nasset management and the question of whether the contractual cash flows of the financial instruments \n\nrepresent Òexclusively payments of principal and interestÓ toward the outst\nanding principal amount.\n For long\n-term investments (equity instruments), IFRS 9 under certain conditions allows a measurement at \nfair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). If these interests, however, are disposed of or \nwritten off, the gains a\nnd losses from these interests which were not realized up to this point are \nreclassified to retained earnings in accordance with IFRS 9.\n DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS/HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n In relation to the accounting of hedge relationships, PUMA made use o\nf the elective right to continue \napplying the rules of IAS 39 for hedge accounting.\n Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value at the time a contract is entered into and \nthereafter. At the time a hedging instrument is concluded, PUMA cla\nssifies the derivatives either as hedges \nof a planned transaction (cash flow hedge) or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability \n\n(fair value hedge).\n At the time when the transaction is concluded, the hedging relationship between the he\ndging instrument \nand the underlying transaction as well as the purpose of risk management and the underlying strategy are \ndocumented. In addition, assessments as to whether the derivatives used in the hedge accounting \ncompensate effectively for a change in\n the fair value or the cash flow of the underlying transaction are \ndocumented at the beginning of and continuously after the hedge accounting.\n Changes in the market value of derivatives that are intended and suitable for cash flow hedges and that \n\nprove to be effective are adjusted against equity, taking into account deferred taxes. If there is no complete \n\neffectiveness, the ineffective part is recognized in the income statement. The amounts recognized in equity \nare recognized in the income statement during \nthe same period in which the hedged planned transaction \naffects the income statement. If, however, a hedged future transaction results in the recognition of a non\n-financial asset or a liability, gains or losses previously recorded in equity are included in\n the initial \nmeasurement of the acquisition costs of the respective asset or liability.\n Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for and are designated as fair value hedges are \n\nrecognized directly in the consolidated income \nstatement, together with changes in the fair value of the \nunderlying transaction attributable to the hedged risk. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and \nthe change in the underlying transaction attributable to the hedged risk are reported in the consolidated \n\nincome statement under the item relating to the underlying transaction.\n The fair values of the derivative instruments used to hedge planned transactions and to hedge the fair value \n\nof a recognized asset or liability are shown under other s\nhort\n-term and long\n-term financial assets \nrespectively liabilities.\n ! \n  185 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n LEASES\n PUMA has concluded leases exclusively as lessee.\n The leases are respectively identified on an individual contract level. PUMA recognizes for all leases a \nright\n-of-use asset and a \nrespective lease liability, with the exception of short\n-term leases (defined as \nleases with a term of no more than 12 months) and low\n-value lease agreements (with an acquisition value \nof the assets of less than \n!5,000). In the case of a short\n-term lease or\n low\n-value lease, the Group \ndepreciates the lease payments on a straight\n-line basis over the term of the lease agreement as other \noperating expense.\n In addition, right\n-of-use assets are not recognized for intangible assets. PUMA has made use of the electiv\ne right and decided not to apply IFRS 16 with regard to leases for intangible assets.\n The lease liability at initial recognition is measured at the present value of the not yet paid lease payments \n\nat the beginning of the lease agreement. The present value \nis calculated using the incremental borrowing \nrate, as the interest rate underlying the lease contract is usually not known.\n The following lease payments are included in the measurement of the lease liability:\n ¥!Fixed lease payments (including in\n-substance f\nixed payments), less any incentive payments to be \nreceived;\n ¥!Variable lease payments based on an index or rate, initially measured based on the index or rate at the \n\nstart of the lease agreement; as a result, future adjustments after changes in the index or \ninterest rate \nremain unrecognized;\n ¥!Exercise price of purchase options, if PUMA is sufficiently certain that it will exercise them;\n ¥!Expected payments from residual value guarantees; and\n ¥!Penalties for the early termination of lease agreements, if PUMA is suf\nficiently certain that it will \nexercise this termination option and if this was taken respectively into account when determining the \n\nterm of the lease agreement.\n  A number of lease agreements, particularly for real estate properties, contain extension and \ntermination \noptions. When determining agreement terms, all facts and circumstances are taken into account that offer \nan economic incentive to exercise the extension option or not exercise the termination option. \nThe changes \nin the term of a lease due to th\ne exercise or non\n-exercise of such options are only taken into account for the \nagreement term if they are sufficiently certain.\n The lease liability is recognized as a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet.\n As described in chapter 1 above, fr\nom January 1, 2020 PUMA will apply the practical recognition exemption \nfor COVID\n-19-related rent concessions to all rent concessions falling within the scope of this measure. \nWhere the conditions are met, the rent concessions will be represented on the bal\nance sheet as if they \nwere variable lease payments. Consequently, the rent concessions will be recognized in the income \n\nstatement in the period in which they were granted.\n The subsequent measurement of the lease liability is done by increasing the carrying\n amount by adding the \naccrued interest of the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying \namount of the lease liability by the lease payments made. Where COVID\n-19-related rent concessions involve \nexemption from lease \npayments, the carrying amount of the lease liability is reduced by the exempted lease \npayments.\n If the term of the lease has changed and this is not a COVID\n-19-related rent concession, or if a material \nevent has led to a change in the assessment relating to the exercise of a purchase option, PUMA will \nremeasure the lease liability by discounting the adjusted lease payments using an updated interest rate and \nwill adjust the corresponding right\n-of-use asset accordingly.\n \n  186 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n If lease payments have changed due to i\nndex or interest rate changes or due to a change in the expected \npayments to be made due to a residual value guarantee, PUMA will remeasure the lease liability by \ndiscounting the adjusted lease payments using an unchanged discount rate. The corresponding r\night\n-of-use \nasset is adjusted accordingly.\n If a lease is changed and this is not a COVID\n-19-related rent concession, and the change in the lease is not \nrecognized as a separate lease, PUMA will remeasure the lease liability based on the lease term for the \nnew lease. As part of this, the changed lease payments are discounted using the updated interest rate at \n\nthe time the change becomes effective.\n The right\n-of-use assets comprise the respective lease liability as part of initial measurement. Lease \ninstallmen\nts that are paid before or at the beginning of the lease must be added. Lease incentives received \nfrom the lessor must be deducted and initial direct costs must be included. If dismantling obligations exist \nwith regard to the leased assets, they are includ\ned in the measurement of the right\n-of-use assets. The \nsubsequent measurement of the right\n-of-use assets is at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation \nand impairment losses.\n The right\n-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the term of the lease\n. If the useful life of the asset \nunderlying the lease is shorter, this limits the depreciation period accordingly. Depreciation starts with the \n\ncommencement of the lease.\n The right\n-of-use assets are recognized as a separate line item in the consolidated b\nalance sheet.\n The right\n-of-use assets are subject to impairment of assets in accordance with IAS 36. As a general rule, \nthe right\n-of-use assets are tested for impairment (impairment test) if there is any indication that the value \nof the asset could be \nimpaired. The right\n-of-use assets, in particular in connection with the GroupÕs own \nretail stores, are subjected to an impairment test if there are indicators or changes in planning \n\nassumptions that suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be\n recoverable. For this purpose, \na so\n-called Òtriggering event testÓ is carried out after the annual budget planning has been prepared or on \nan occasional basis.\n The value in use is determined for each retail store using the discounted cash flow method. The\n value in use \nis determined on the basis of the planned cash flows for the retail stores according to the budget, which is \n\nprepared on a bottom\n-up basis and approved by management. The forecast period is derived from the \nexpected useful lives of the respec\ntive retail store and is reviewed annually. With reference to the bottom\n-up budget, country\n- \nand CGU\n-specific sales and cost developments are used as a basis for the remaining \nuseful life. The growth rates used are based on the expected nominal retail grow\nth in the respective market \nfor the respective planning year. All retail stores are experiencing growth rates in a single\n-digit to low \ndouble\n-digit percentage range. Cash flows were discounted at a weighted average cost of capital rate of \nbetween 3.7% and \n18.9% when determining the value in use of retail stores. This was based on a risk\n-free \ninterest rate on equivalent term structures of 0.4% and a market risk premium of 7.8%. The value in use is \n\ncompared with the carrying amount of the assets allocated to \nthe retail store (in particular, right\n-of-use \nassets from the lease, tenant fixtures, inventories and proportionate corporate assets allocated to the \n\ncentral areas). If the carrying amount of the assets of the retail stores exceeds the determined value in \nuse, \nthe fair value of the cash\n-generating unit is also calculated. If an impairment occurs, the fair value of the \nright\n-of-use asset is determined separately, taking into account materiality aspects, using internal or \nexternal data sources.\n Where \nthere are indications that stores that have previously been written down have achieved a turnaround \nand are again recoverable, an additional triggering event test is carried out and, where applicable, a \n\nreversal of impairment loss is recorded to the maximu\nm amount of the amortized costs.\n ! \n  187 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n Variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or interest rate are not included in the \nvaluation of the lease liabilities. These payments are recognized in the income statement as other expenses \nas soon as PU\nMA has received the underlying benefit. This applies primarily to turnover\n-based rents for \nretail stores.\n As part of the practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits omitting to separate between non\n-leasing components \nand leasing components. With regard to land an\nd buildings, PUMA generally does not apply the practical \nexpedient so that the right\n-of-use assets relating to land and buildings only contain leasing components. \nWith regard to other right\n-of-use assets (comprising technical equipment &amp; machines and motor\n vehicles), \nthe practical expedient is generally applied, as a result of which the leasing components and non\n-leasing \ncomponents are both recognized.\n CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n Cash and cash equivalents include cash and bank balances. To the extent that ban\nk deposits are not \nimmediately required to finance current assets, they are invested as fixed\n-term deposits for a term of up to \nthree months. The total amount of cash and cash equivalents is consistent with the cash and cash \n\nequivalents stated in the cash \nflow statement.\n Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. They are subject to the impairment \nrequirements in accordance with IFRS 9 ÒFinancial Instruments.Ó PUMA monitors the credit risk of these \n\nfinancial instruments taking into account th\ne economic situation, external credit rating and/or premiums \nfor credit default swaps (CDS) of other financial institutions. The credit risk from cash and cash equivalents \n\nis classified as immaterial, due to the relatively short terms and the investment\n-grade credit rating of the \ncounterparty, which signals a low probability of default.\n INVENTORIES\n Inventories are measured at acquisition or manufacturing costs or at the lower net realizable values \n\nderived from the selling price on the balance sheet date. Th\ne acquisition cost of merchandise is determined \nusing an averaging method. Value adjustments are adequately recorded, depending on age, seasonality and \n\nrealizable market prices, in a manner that is standard throughout the Group.\n TRADE RECEIVABLES\n Trade rec\neivables are initially measured at the transaction price and subsequently at amortized cost with \ndeduction of value adjustments, in the form of a provision for risks. The transaction price according to IFRS \n15 ÒRevenue from Contracts with CustomersÓ is the\n amount of the consideration expected by the company \nfor the delivery of goods or the provision of services to customers, not taking into account the amounts \n\ncollected on behalf of third parties.\n When determining the provision for risks for trade receivabl\nes, PUMA uniformly applies the simplified \nmethod in order to determine the expected credit losses over the remaining lifetime of the trade \n\nreceivables (called Òlifetime expected credit lossesÓ) in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 ÒFinancial \n\nInstrum\nents.Ó For this, trade receivables are classified by geographic region to suitable groups with shared \ncredit risk characteristics. The expected credit losses are calculated using a matrix that presents the age \n\nstructure of the receivables and depicts a lik\nelihood of loss for the individual maturity bands of the \nreceivables on the basis of historic credit loss events and future\n-based factors. The percentage rates for \nthe loss likelihoods are checked regularly to ensure they are up to date. If objective indic\nations of a credit \nimpairment are found regarding the trade receivables of a certain customer, a detailed analysis of this \n\ncustomerÕs specific credit risk is conducted and an individual provision for risks is established for the trade \n\nreceivables with resp\nect to this customer. If a credit insurance is in place, it is taken into account in the \namount of the provision for risks.\n ! \n  188 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS\n Other financial assets are classified based on the business model for control and the cash flows of the \nfin\nancial assets. In the Group, financial assets are generally held under a business model that provides for \nÒholdingÓ the asset until maturity, in order to collect the contractual cash flows. The subsequent \nmeasurement of the other financial assets is theref\nore always carried out at amortized cost, taking into \naccount the respective impairment losses. The business model ÒtradingÓ is not used.\n The non\n-current assets contain loans and other assets. Non\n-interest\n-bearing non\n-current assets are \ndiscounted to prese\nnt value if the resulting effect is significant.\n NON\n-CURRENT INVESTMENTS\n The investments recognized under non\n-current financial assets belong to the category Òmeasured at fair \nvalue through other comprehensive incomeÓ (FVOCI), since these investments are h\neld over the long term \nfor strategic reasons.\n All purchases and disposals of non\n-current investments are recorded on the trade date. Non\n-current \ninvestments are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. They are also recognized at fair \nval\nue in subsequent periods if this can be reliably determined. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized \nin the Other Comprehensive Income, taking into account deferred taxes. The gain or loss on disposal of \nnon-current investments is transferred to retaine\nd earnings.\n The category Òmeasured at fair value through profit or lossÓ (FVPL) is not used with regard to non\n-current \ninvestments.\n PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n Property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition costs, net of accumulated depreciati\non. The \ndepreciation period depends on the expected useful life of the respective item. The straight\n-line method of \ndepreciation is applied. The useful life depends on the type of the assets involved. Buildings are subject to a \nuseful life of between ten and fifty years, and a useful life of between three to ten years is assumed for \n\nmovable assets. The acquisition costs of property, plant and equipment also include interest on borrowings \n\nin accordance with IAS 23, insofar as these accrue and the effect is significant.\n Repair and maintenance costs are recorded as an expense as of the date on which they were incurred. \nSubstantial improvements and upgrades are capitalized to the extent that the criteria for capitalization of an \n\nasset item apply.\n GOODWILL\n Goodwi\nll resulting from a business combination is calculated based on the difference between the \ntransferred consideration and the GroupÕs share in the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities.\n Goodwill amounts are allocated to the GroupÕs cash\n-generati\nng units that are expected to benefit from the \nsynergy effects resulting from the business combination.\n An impairment test of goodwill per group of cash\n-generating units (usually the smallest company level at \nwhich goodwill is monitored) is performed once \na year and whenever there are indicators of impairment \nand can result in an impairment loss. There is no reversal of an impairment loss for goodwill. See chapter \n11 for further details, in particular regarding the assumptions used for the calculation.\n ! \n  189 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n Acquired intangible assets largely consist of concessions, intellectual property rights and similar rights. \nThese are measured at acquisition costs, net of accumulated amortization. The useful life of intangible \nassets is \nbetween three and ten years. Depreciation is done on a straight\n-line basis.\n If the capitalization requirements of IAS 38.57 ÒIntangible AssetsÓ are met cumulatively, expenses in the \n\ndevelopment phase for internally generated intangible assets are capitaliz\ned at the time they arise. In \nsubsequent periods, internally generated intangible assets and acquired intangible assets are measured at \n\ncost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. In the Group, own work capitalized is generally \ndepreciated on\n a straight\n-line basis over a useful life of 3 years.\n The item also includes acquired trademark rights, which are assumed to have an indefinite useful life in \nlight of the history of the brands and due to the fact that the brands are continued by PUMA.\n IMP\nAIRMENT OF ASSETS\n Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized according to schedule but are subjected to \n\nan annual impairment test. Property, plant and equipment, right\n-of-use assets, and other intangible assets \nwith finite useful li\nves are tested for impairment if there is any indication of impairment in the value of the \nasset concerned. In order to determine whether there is a requirement to record the impairment of an \n\nasset, the recoverable amount of the respective asset (the highe\nr amount of the fair value less costs to sell \nand value in use) is compared with the carrying amount of the asset. If the recoverable amount is lower \n\nthan the carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. The test for impairment is \n\nperformed, if possible, at the level of the respective individual asset, otherwise at the level of the cash\n-generating unit. Goodwill, on the other hand, is tested for impairment only at the level of a group of cash\n-generating units. If it is determined withi\nn the scope of the impairment test that an asset needs to be \nwritten down, then the goodwill, if any, of the group of cash\n-generating units is written down initially and, in \na second step, the remaining amount is distributed proportionately over the remain\ning assets within the \napplication scope of IAS 36. If the reason for the recorded impairment no longer applies, a reversal of \n\nimpairment loss is recorded to the maximum amount of the amortized costs. There is no reversal of an \nimpairment loss for goodwill.\n Impairment tests are performed using the discounted cash flow method. For determining the fair value less \ncosts to sell and value in use, the expected cash flows are based on corporate planning data. Expected cash \n\nflows are discounted using an interest ra\nte in line with market conditions. As part of the fair value \ndetermination less cost to sell, no special synergies of cash\n-generating units are taken into account, and \ncorporate planning data is adjusted to the assumptions of market participants, if requir\ned. Moreover, there \nis a difference between the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use because the costs to sell are \n\nalso taken into account.\n Trademarks with an indefinite useful life are subjected to an impairment test based on the relief\n-from\n-royalty method during the financial year or when the occasion arises. Should indications of a value \n\nimpairment of a self\n-used trademark arise, the recoverability of the trademark is not only measured \nindividually using the relief\n-from\n-royalty method, but \nthe recoverable amount of the group of cash\n-generating units to which the trademark is to be allocated is also determined.\n See chapter 11 for further details, in particular regarding the assumptions used for the calculation.\n ! \n  190 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n FINANCIAL DEBT, OTHER FINANCI\nAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER LIABILITIES\n In general, these items are recognized at their acquisition cost, taking into account transaction costs and \nsubsequently recognized at amortized cost. Non\n-interest or low\n-interest\n-bearing liabilities with a term of at \nleast one year are recognized at present value, taking into account an interest rate in line with market \nconditions, and are compounded until their maturity at their repayment amount.\n  \nThe category Òmeasured at fair value through profit or lossÓ (FVPL) is n\not used with regard to financial \nliabilities.\n Current financial liabilities also include those long\n-term loans that have a maximum residual term of up to \none year.\n PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS\n In addition to defined benefit plans, some c\nompanies apply defined contribution plans, which do not result \nin any additional pension commitment other than the current contributions. The pension provision under \ndefined benefit plans is generally calculated using the projected unit credit method. This\n method takes into \naccount not only known pension benefits and pension rights accrued as of the reporting date, but also \nexpected future salary and pension increases. The defined benefit obligation (DBO) is calculated by \ndiscounting expected future cash ou\ntflows at the rate of return on senior, fixed\n-rate corporate bonds. The \ncurrencies and maturity periods of the underlying corporate bonds are consistent with the currencies and \n\nmaturity periods of the obligations to be satisfied. In some of the plans, the \nobligation is accompanied by a \nplan asset. In that case, the pension provision shown is reduced by the plan asset.\n Revaluations, consisting of actuarial profits and losses, changes resulting from use of the asset ceiling and \nreturn on plan assets (without \ninterest on the net debt) are immediately recorded under Other \nComprehensive Income. The revaluations recorded in Other Comprehensive Income are part of the retained \nearnings and are no longer reclassified into the income statement. Past service costs are \nrecorded as an \nexpense if changes are made to the plan.\n Details regarding the assumed life expectancy and the mortality tables used are shown in chapter 15.\n OTHER PROVISIONS\n Provisions are recognized if the Group, as a result of a past event, has a current\n obligation and this \nobligation is likely to result in an outflow of resources with economic benefits, the amount of which can be \nreliably estimated. The provisions are recognized at their settlement value as determined on the basis of \n\nthe best possible estimate and are not offset by income. Non\n-current provisions are discounted.\n Provisions for the expected expenses from warranty obligations pursuant to the respective national sales \n\ncontract laws are recognized at the time of sale of the relevant products, \naccording to the best estimate in \nrelation to the expenditure needed in order to fulfill the GroupÕs obligation.\n Provisions are also recognized to account for onerous contracts. An onerous contract is assumed to exist \n\nwhere the unavoidable costs for fulfil\nling the contract exceed the economic benefit arising from this \ncontract.\n Provisions for restructuring measures are also recorded if a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been \nprepared, which has created a justified expectation that the restructuring m\neasures will be carried out by \nthose concerned due to its implementation starting or its major components being announced.\n ! \n  191 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated \nFinancial Statements\n TREASURY STOCK\n Treasury stock is deducted from equity at its market price as of the date of acquisition, plus incidental \nacquisitio\nn costs. Pursuant to the authorization of the Annual General Meeting, treasury stock can be \nrepurchased for any authorized purpose, including the flexible management of the CompanyÕs capital \n\nrequirements.\n MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n PUMA uses \ncash-settled share\n-based payments and key performance indicator\n-based long\n-term incentive \nprograms.\n For cash\n-settled share\n-based payments, a liability is recorded for the services received and measured with \nits fair value upon recognition. Until the debt i\ns cleared, its fair value is recalculated on every balance sheet \ndate and on the settlement date and all changes to the fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n During the three\n-year term of the respective programs, the medium\n-term targets of the PUMA Group with \nregard to operating result (EBIT), cash flow and gross profit margin are determined for key figure\n-based \ncompensation processes and recognized in the income statement as Other Provisions with their respective \ndegree of target achievemen\nt. RECOGNITION OF SALES REVENUES\n The Group recognizes sales revenues from the sale of sporting goods. The sales revenues are measured at \nfair value of the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled from the contract with the \n\ncustomer, taking i\nnto account returns, discounts and rebates. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties \nare not included in the sales revenues. The Group records sales revenues at the time when PUMA fulfills its \nperformance obligation to the customer and has transferred \nthe right of disposal over the product to the \ncustomer.\n The Group sells footwear, apparel and accessories both to wholesalers and directly to customers through \nits own retail stores. Meanwhile, the sales\n-related warranty services cannot be purchased separa\ntely and \ndo not lead to services that go beyond the assurance of the specifications at the time of the transfer of risk. \n\nAccordingly, the Group records warranties in the balance sheet in conformity with IAS 37 provisions, \ncontingent liabilities and conting\nent assets.\n In the case of sales of products to wholesalers, the sales revenue is recorded at the date on which the right \nof disposal over the products is transferred to the customer, in other words, when the products have been \n\nshipped to the specific loca\ntion of the wholesaler (delivery). After delivery, the wholesaler bears the \ninventory risk and has full right of disposal over the manner and means of distribution and the selling price \n\nof the products. In the case of sales to end customers in the GroupÕs own retail stores, the sales revenues \nare recorded at the date when the right of disposal over the products is transferred to the end customer, in \nother words, the date on which the end customer buys the products in the retail shop. The payment of the \n\npurc\nhase price is due as soon as the customer purchases the products.\n Under certain conditions and according to the contractual stipulations, the customer has the option to \n\nexchange products or return them for a credit. The amount of the expected returns is es\ntimated on the \nbasis of past experience and is deducted from sales revenues by a provision for returns. The asset value of \nthe right arising from the product return claim is recorded under Inventories and leads to a corresponding \nreduction of cost of sales\n. \n! \n  192 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME\n The Group records royalty and commission income from the licensing of trademark rights to third parties. \nIncome from royalties is recognized in the income statement in accordance with the invoices to be \nsubmitted by the li\ncensees. In certain cases, values must be estimated in order to permit accounting on an \naccrual basis. Commission income is invoiced if the underlying purchase transaction is classified as \n\nrealized.\n ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES\n Advertising expenses\n are recognized in the income statement as of the date of their accrual. In general, \npromotional expenses stretching over several years are recognized as an expense over the contractual \nterm on an accrual basis. Any expenditure surplus resulting from this \nallocation of expenses after the \n\nbalance sheet date are recognized in the form of an impairment of assets or a provision for anticipated \n\nlosses in the financial statements.\n PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n PUMA continuously develops new products in order to meet market\n requirements and market changes. \nResearch costs are expensed in full at the time they are incurred. Development costs are also recognized \nas an expense when they do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ÒIntangible Assets.Ó\n GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n In the \nfinancial year 2020, PUMA received government grants related to income at a global level for the first \ntime as a result of the COVID\n-19 pandemic; these were then deducted from the corresponding expenses in \nthe income statement. Grants are received via country\n-specific, one\n-off emergency aid schemes relating to \nthe global COVID\n-19 pandemic and via country\n-specific short\n-time work programs, provided that they meet \nthe requirements of IAS 20 and other comparable measures.\n Pursuant to IAS 20.7, government grant\ns related to income are recognized when there is reasonable \nassurance that the entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received. \nGrants related to income are deducted from the corresponding expenses in the income sta\ntement (net \npresentation).\n FINANCIAL RESULT\n The financial result includes interest income from financial investments and interest expenses from loans, \nalong with interest income and expenses in connection with derivative financial instruments. Financial \n\nresults also include interest expenses from lease liabilities, discounted, non\n-current liabilities and from \npension provisions that are associated with business combinations or arise from the measurement of \n\npension commitments.\n Exchange rate effects that can\n be directly allocated to an underlying transaction are shown in the \nrespective income statement item.\n INCOME TAXES\n Current income taxes are determined in accordance with the tax regulations of the respective countries \n\nwhere the individual Group companies \nconduct their operations.\n ! \n  193 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n DEFERRED TAXES\n Deferred taxes resulting from temporary valuation differences between the IFRS and tax balance sheets of \nindividual Group companies and from consolidation procedures, which are levied by the same taxation \nauthorit\ny and can be netted, are charged to each taxable entity and recognized either as deferred tax assets \nor deferred tax liabilities.\n With regard to the leases that were capitalized, tax deduction potential is allocated to the respective right\n-of-use asset. If\n temporary differences arise during subsequent valuation from a netting perspective of \nright\n-of-use asset and lease liability, deferred tax items will be created, provided the requirements under \nIAS 12 are met.\n Deferred tax assets may also include \nclaims for tax reductions that result from the expected utilization of \n\nexisting losses carried forward to subsequent years and which is sufficiently certain to materialize. \n\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities may also result from accounting treatments that \ndo not affect the income \nstatement. Deferred taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax rates that apply to the reversal in the \n\nindividual countries and that are in force or adopted as of the balance sheet date.\n Deferred tax assets are recognized only to\n the extent that the respective tax advantage is likely to \nmaterialize. Value adjustments are recognized on the basis of the past earnings situation and the business \n\nexpectations for the foreseeable future, if this criterion is not fulfilled.\n ASSUMPTIONS A\nND ESTIMATES\n The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires some assumptions and estimates that \nhave an impact on the measurement and presentation of the recognized assets and liabilities, income and \nexpenses, as well as \ncontingent liabilities. The assumptions and estimates are based on premises, which in \nturn are based on currently available information. In individual cases, the actual values may deviate from \nthe assumptions and estimates made. Consequently, future period\ns involve a risk of adjustment to the \ncarrying amount of the assets and liabilities concerned. If the actual development differs from the \n\nexpectation, the premises and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are \n\nadjusted \nwith an effect on profit or loss.\n All assumptions and estimates are continuously reassessed. They are based on historical experiences and \n\nother factors, including expectations regarding future global and industry\n-related trends that appear \nreasonable under\n the current circumstances. PUMA applies scenarios that assume that the situation \ncreated by the COVID\n-19 pandemic will not be long term. Accordingly, PUMA does not expect that the \nimpact on the consolidated financial statements will be significant or seri\nous. Assumptions and estimates \nare made in particular with regard to evaluating the control of companies with non\n-controlling interests, \nthe measurement of goodwill and brands, pension obligations, derivative financial instruments, leases and \n\ntaxes. The mo\nst significant forward\n-looking assumptions and sources of estimation and uncertainty as of \nthe reporting date concerning the above\n-mentioned items are discussed below.\n Goodwill and Brands\n A review of the impairment of goodwill is based on the calculation o\nf the value in use as a leading valuation \nconcept. In order to calculate the value in use, the Group must estimate the future cash flows from those \n\ncash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. To this end, the data used were from the three\n-yea\nr plan, which is based on forecasts of the overall economic development and the resulting industry\n-specific consumer behavior. As it is currently difficult to predict what the global consequences of the \n\nCOVID\n-19 pandemic will be in the short and medium ter\nm, these assumptions and estimates are generally \nsubject to increased uncertainty. However, it is assumed that COVID\n-19 vaccine will be made available and \nthat large parts of the population in the main PUMA markets will be immunized in 2021, and that \n\nconse\nquently, business activities for the financial year 2021 will largely normalize to the level seen before \nthe outbreak of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. Another key assumption concerns the determination of an \nappropriate interest rate for discounting the cash flow \nto present value (discounted cash flow method). The \n\n  194 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n Òrelief from royalty methodÓ is used to value brands. See chapter 11 for further details, in particular \nregarding the assumptions used for the calculation.\n Pension Obligations\n Pension obligations are dete\nrmined using an actuarial calculation. This calculation is contingent on a large \nnumber of factors that are based on assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rate, the expected \n\nreturn on plan assets, future wage and salary increases, mortality and \nfuture pension increases. Due to the \nlong\n-term nature of the commitments made, the assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties. Any \nchange in these assumptions has an impact on the carrying amount of the pension obligations. The Group \n\ndetermines a\nt the end of each year the discount rate applied to determine the present value of future \npayments. This discount rate is based on the interest rates of corporate bonds with the highest credit rating \nthat are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are paid and the maturity of which corresponds \n\nto that of the pension obligations. See chapter 15 for further details, in particular regarding the parameters \n\nused for the calculation.\n Taxes\n Tax items are determined taking into account the various prevai\nling local tax laws and the relevant \nadministrative opinions and, due to their complexity, may be subject to different interpretations by persons \nsubject to tax on the one hand and the tax authorities on the other hand. Differing interpretations of tax laws \nmay result in subsequent tax payments for past years; depending on the managementÕs assessment, these \n\ndiffering opinions may be taken into account using the most probable amount for the respective case.\n The recognition of deferred taxes, in particular wi\nth respect to tax losses carried forward, requires that \nestimates and assumptions be made concerning future tax planning strategies as well as expected dates of \n\noccurrence and the amount of future taxable income. The taxable income from the relevant corporate \nplanning is derived for this judgment. This takes into account the past financial position and the business \ndevelopment expected in the future. Due to the currently difficult to predict short\n- \nand medium\n-term \nconsequences of the global COVID\n-19 pandemi\nc, these assumptions and estimates are generally subject to \nincreased uncertainty. Deferred tax assets on losses carried forward are recorded in the event of \n\ncompanies incurring a loss only if it is highly probable that future positive income will be achie\nved that can \nbe offset against these tax losses carried forward in the next 5 years. See chapter 8 for further information \nand detailed assumptions.\n Derivative Financial Instruments\n The assumptions used for estimating derivative financial instruments are b\nased on the prevailing market \nconditions as of the balance sheet date and thus reflect the fair value. See chapter 24 for further \n\ninformation.\n Leases\n The measurement of the lease liabilities is based on assumptions for the discount rates used, the lease \nterm and the identification of fixed lease payments. To determine the present value of future minimum \nlease payments, PUMA uses country\n- \nand currency\n-specific interest rates on borrowings with compatible \nterms. In addition to the basic lease period, the Grou\np includes extension options in the determination of \nthe lease term if management is sufficiently certain that such an option will be exercised after taking into \n\naccount all facts and circumstances. The fixed lease payments also include firmly agreed upon \nminimum \namounts for agreements with a predominantly variable lease amount.\n ! \n  195 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

Deferred tax assets were recognized for these items in the amount at which the associated tax advantages \nare likely to be realized in the form of future \nprofits for income tax purposes. Accordingly, deferred tax \nassets for tax loss carryforwards in the amount of \n!41.9\n million\n (previous year: \n!52.0\n million\n) were not \nrecognized; of these, \n!39.9\n million\n (previous year: \n!51.3\n million\n) cannot expire, but \n!11.3\n million\n (previous \nyear: \n!13.6\n million\n) will never be usable due to the absence of future expectations. The remaining \nunrecognized deferred tax receivables of \n!2.1\n million\n (previous year: \n!0.7\n million\n) will expire within the \nnext six years.\n In addition, no \ndeferred taxes were recognized for deductible temporary differences amounting to \n!6.3\n million\n (previous year: \n!4.4\n million\n) because their realization was not expected as of the balance sheet \ndate.\n Deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes from possibl\ne dividends on retained earnings of subsidiaries \nthat serve to cover the financing needs of the respective company were not accumulated, since it is most \nlikely that such temporary differences will not be cleared in the near future.\n ! \n  200 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n Intangible Assets mainly include goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, assets associated \nwith the CompanyÕs own retail activities and software licenses.\n Goodwill and \nintangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized according to schedule. \nImpairment tests with regard to goodwill were performed in the past financial year using the discounted \n\ncash flow method. The data from the three\n-year plan for the resp\nective cash\n-generating unit or group of \ncash-generating units was used as a basis for this. Planning on the level of the cash\n-generating units was \nthereby derived from the PUMA GroupÕs three\n-year plan. Assuming that a COVID\n-19 vaccine is made \navailable and\n that large parts of the population in the main PUMA markets are immunized in 2021, Group\n-level planning shows that business activities for the financial year 2021 will largely normalize to the level \n\nseen before the outbreak of the COVID\n-19 pandemic. On th\nis basis, and assuming that COVID\n-19 will not \nhave a long\n-term negative impact on the global economy, further sales growth and a further improved EBIT \nmargin are expected in subsequent financial years. Alongside the normalization of business activities to \nthe \nlevel seen before the outbreak of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, planned sales growth is based on the good future \ngrowth prospects in the sporting goods industry and on the gaining of market shares by PUMA. This is to be \n\nachieved, in particular, via the contin\nued consistent implementation of the Forever Faster corporate \nstrategy and the increase in PUMAÕs brand heat. The improvement in EBIT\n-margin in the planning period is \nthe result of a slight increase in gross profit margin due, for example, to a higher shar\ne of own retail sales \nas a result of above\n-average growth of the e\n-commerce distribution channel. Furthermore, the slightly \nweaker percentage increase of other operating income and expenses compared to sales is also expected to \n\ncontribute to the improvemen\nt of the EBIT\n-margin; for example, the operating requirements for planned \nsales growth over the coming years have essentially been met, meaning that economies of scale can be \n\nrealized. The planning of investments and working capital is based on historical \nexperience and is carried \nout in accordance with strategic objectives. The future tax payments are based on current tax rates. For \n\nperiods beyond the budget planning, an annual growth rate is determined and used to forecast future cash \nflows beyond the thr\nee-year period. The assumed growth rate is based on long\n-term expectations on \ninflation rate and may not exceed the long\n-term average growth rates for the business area in which the \nrespective cash\n-generating unit, or group of cash\n-generating units, operat\nes. The recoverable amount for the respective cash\n-generating unit or group of cash\n-generating units was \ndetermined on the basis of the value\n-in-use. This resulted in an impairment loss for one cash\n-generating \nunit.\n \n  204 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n The group of cash\n-generating units ÒSout\nh AfricaÓ includes goodwill before impairment of \n!1.9\n million\n (previous year: \n!2.3\n million\n). These are allocated to the EEMEA segment. Due to an adjustment of earnings \nprospects, when calculating the recoverable amount an impairment loss of \n!1.9\n million\n was incurred. The \nrecoverable amount of \n!30.3\n million\n was determined by a value\n-in-use calculation with a discount rate of \n12.4% p.a. (previous year: 10.8% p.a.) and a growth rate of 1.7% (previous year: 2.0%). The impairment is \nincluded in the item ÒOther O\nperating Income and ExpensesÓ in the consolidated income statement.\n In connection with the Golf business unit (CPG\n Ð \nCobra PUMA Golf), the Cobra brand exists as an intangible \nasset with an indefinite useful life amounting to \n!115.9\n million\n (previous year: \n!126.6\n million\n). The carrying \namount of the Cobra brand is significant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of the intangible \n\nassets with an indefinite useful life. It was assigned to the North America business segment, where the \n\nheadquarter of Cobra PUMA Golf is located. The recoverable amount of the Cobra brand (level 3) was \ndetermined using the relief\n-from\n-royalty method. A discount rate of 6.4% p.a. (previous year: 5.9% p.a.), a \nroyalty rate of 8% (previous year: 8%) and a 1.7% \ngrowth rate (previous year: 2%) was used.\n If indications of a value impairment of a self\n-used trademark should arise, the trademark is not only valued \nindividually using the relief\n-from\n-royalty method, but the recoverable amount of the group of cash\n-genera\nting units to which the trademark is to be allocated is also determined. In 2020, there were no \n\nindications of an impairment.\n In the financial year, development costs in connection with Cobra brand golf clubs amounting to \n\n!1.8\n million\n (previous year: \n!1.8\n million\n) were capitalized. Development costs are allocated to the item \nOther Intangible Assets in ÒChanges in Fixed Assets.Ó Current amortization of development costs amounted \nto \n!2.3\n million\n in the financial year (previous year: \n!1.8\n million\n). The changes\n in intangible assets in the financial year are shown in ÒChanges in Fixed AssetsÓ of Appendix 1 \nto the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The item other intangible assets includes advance \npayments in the amount of \n!22.8\n million\n (previous year: \n!9.9\n million\n). The current amortization of intangible assets in the amount of \n!24.4\n million\n (previous year: \n!23.5\n million\n) is \nincluded in the other operating expenses. Of this, \n!3.8\n million\n relate to sales and distribution expenses \n(previous year: \n!4.6\n m\nillion\n), !0.1\n million\n to expenses for product management/ merchandising (previous \nyear: \n!0.1\n million\n), !2.3\n million\n to development expenses (previous year: \n!1.8\n million\n), and \n!18.3\n million\n to \nadministrative and general expenses (previous year: \n!17.0\n millio\nn). Impairment expenses exceeding \ncurrent depreciation of \n!1.9\n million\n (previous year: \n!0.0\n million\n) were incurred.\n Goodwill is allocated to the GroupÕs identifiable group of cash\n-generating units (CGUs) according to the \ncountries where the activities are carried out.

Consolidated Financial Stateme\nnts\n The tax rates used for the impairment test correspond to the actual tax rates in the respective countri\nes. \nThe cost of capital (WACC) was derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation taking into \naccount a market\n-weighted five\n-year average debt/equity structure and financing costs, respectively taking \ninto account the main competitors of the r\nespective group of cash\n-generating units.\n  \nIn addition, a growth rate of 1.7% (previous year: 2%) is generally assumed. A growth rate of less than 1.7% \n(previous year: less than 2%) was applied only in justified exceptional cases, where the long\n-term \nexpec\ntations on inflation rate for the country in which the cash\n-generating unit operates were lower than \nthe assumed growth rate; this applies, in particular, to Japan and Taiwan.\n The cash\n-generating unit stichd\n includes goodwill of \n!139.4\n million\n (previous year: \n!139.4\n million\n), which is \nsignificant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of goodwill. The recoverable amount was \n\ndetermined by a value\n-in-use calculation with a discount rate of 6.1% p.a. (prev\nious year: 5.9% p.a.) and a \ngrowth rate of 1.7% (previous year: 2%).\n Sensitivity analyses with regard to the impairment tests carried out as of the balance sheet date show that \n\nneither an increase in discount rates by one percentage point, respectively, no\nr a reduction in growth rates \nby one percentage point, respectively, results in any indication of impairment. Furthermore, due to the \n\nincreased uncertainty as a result of the COVID\n-19 pandemic, in the financial year 2020 additional sensitivity \nanalyses were carried out with regard to the impairment tests. Alongside an increase in discount rates by \n\none percentage point, respectively, and a simultaneous reduction in growth rates by one percentage point, \n\nrespectively, these analyses also assume a reduction in \noperating result (EBIT) of 10% respectively in the \nunderlying three\n-year plan.

Accordingly, as of the reporting date, the carrying \n\namount approximates fair value. The non\n-current bank liabilities consist of fixed\n-interest loans. The \ncarrying amount represents a reasonable approximation of their fair value as the interest rate differential is \n\nnot significant at the reporting date.\n Trade payables have short residual maturities; their carrying amounts therefore appro\nximate fair value.\n The remaining financial liabilities have short residual maturities; the recognized amounts therefore \n\napproximate fair value.\n The fair values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date are determined on the basis of \n\ncurrent market parameters, i.e. reference prices observable on the market, taking into account forward \n\npremiums and discounts. The discounted result of the comparison of the forward price on the reporting \ndate with the forward price on the valuation date i\ns included in the measurement. The fair values are also \nchecked for the counterpartyÕs non\n-performance risk. In doing this, PUMA calculates credit value \nadjustments (CVA) or debt value adjustments (DVA) on the basis of an up/down method, taking current \nmar\nket information into account.

PENSION PROVISIONS\n Pension provisions result from employeesÕ claims\n for benefits, which are based on the statutory or \ncontractual regulations applicable in the respective country, in the event of invalidity, death or when a \ncertain retirement age has been reached. Pension commitments in the PUMA Group include both benefit\n- \nand contribution\n-based pension commitments and include both obligations from current pensions and \nrights to pensions payable in the future. The pension entitlements are financed by both provisions and \n\nfunds.\n The risks associated with the pension commitme\nnts mainly concern the usual risks of benefit\n-based \npension plans in relation to possible changes in the discount rate and, to a minor degree, inflation trends \n\nand recipient longevity. In order to limit the risks of changed capital market conditions and de\nmographic \ndevelopments, plans with the maximum obligations were agreed or insured a few years ago in Germany and \n\nthe UK for new hires. The specific risk of obligations based on salary is low within the PUMA Group.

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n In or\nder to bind the management to the company by a long\n-term incentive, virtual shares with cash \nsettlement and other long\n-term incentive programs are used at PUMA.\n The current programs are described below:\n  \n  225 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n EXPLANATION OF ÒVIRTUAL \nSHARESÓ, TERMED ÒMONETARY UNITSÓ\n Monetary units were granted on an annual basis beginning in 2013 as part of a management incentive program. Monetary units ar\ne based on the PUMA share \nperformance. Each of these monetary units entitles the holder to a cash payment at the end of the term. The entitled cash payment compares the performance using the \naverage virtual appreciation rights of the last thirty trading days before the start of the year of issue with the virtual ap\npreciation rights of the last thirty t\nrading days \nbefore the exercise date. Monetary units are subject to a vesting period of three years. After that, there is an exercise per\niod of two years (starting with each quarterly \npublication date for a period of 30 days) which can be freely used by pa\nrticipants for the purposes of execution. The fundamental exercise condition after the vesting \nperiod is the existence of an active employment relationship with PUMA until the end of the vesting period.\n In the financial year 2020, an expense of \n!11.0\n milli\non was recorded for this purpose on the basis of the employment contract commitments to the Management Board \nmembers.\n !!T.50 \nVIRTUAL SHARES (MONETARY UNITS)\n Issue date\n 1/1/2016\n 1/1/2017\n 1/1/2018\n 1/1/2019\n 1/1/2020\n  Term\n 5 5 5 5 5 Years\n Vesting period\n 3 3 3 3 3 Years\n Base price PUMA share at issue\n 20.00\n 24.00\n 37.10\n 44.40\n 67.69\n EUR/share\n Reference value PUMA\n-share at the end of the financial year\n N/A\n N/A\n 86.23\n 57.49\n 28.74\n EUR/share\n Participants in year of issue\n 3 3 3 3 3 Persons\n Participants at the end \nof the financial year\n 2 2 2 3 3 Persons\n Number of monetary units as of 1/1/2020\n 88,620\n 107,360\n 117,440\n 97,320\n 65,993\n Shares\n Number of monetary units exercised in the FY\n -88,620\n -107,360\n 0 0 0 Shares\n Number of monetary units expired in the FY\n 0 0 -4,923\n 0 0 Shares\n Final number of monetary units as of 12/31/2020\n 0 0 112,517\n 97,320 65,993\n Shares\n         \n  226 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n In the financial year 2019, a stock split was performed with a ratio of 1:10. As a result of this, all past share \nvalues were divided by a factor of 10 and all monetary units were multiplied by a factor of 10.\n This commitment consisting of share\n-based remuneration transactions with cash compensation is \nrecorded as personnel provisions and remeasured at fair value on e\nvery balance sheet date, provided it has \nnot been exercised yet. The expenses are recorded over the vesting period. Based on the prorated average \n\nshare price of the last thirty trading days in 2020 and taking into account the intra\n-year exercise date in \n2020, the provisions for this program amounted to \n!17.2\n million\n at the end of the financial year.\n EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2020" PROGRAM\n In addition, in 2017, an additional Long\n-Term Incentive Program, the global "Game Changer 2020" program, \nwas \nlaunched. Participants in this program consist mainly of top executives reporting to the Management \nBoard and individual key positions in the PUMA Group. The aim of this program is to bind this group of \n\nemployees to the Company on a long\n-term basis and to \nallow them to share in the medium\n-term success of \nthe Company.\n The term of the program is 3 years and is based on the medium\n-term objectives of the PUMA Group in \nterms of EBIT (70%), cash flow (15%) and gross profit margin (15%). For this purpose, a corres\nponding \nprovision is set up each year when the respective currency\n-adjusted targets are met. The resulting balance \nof \n!3.7\n million\n were paid out to the participants in March 2020. The payment was subject to the condition \nthat the individual participant was\n in an unterminated employment relationship with a company of the \nPUMA Group as of December 31, 2019. No further expenses were incurred for this program in the year \nunder review.\n EXPLANATION OF THE "MOMENTUM 2020" PROGRAM\n In addition, a global program call\ned "Momentum" was launched in 2017, which is subject to the same \nparameters (employment until December 31, 2019 and payout in March 2020) as the Game Changer 2020 \n\nprogram. The difference to the Game Changer program lies in the different participants. While\n the \nparticipants in the Game Changer program consist of top executives, the "Momentum" program includes \n\nemployees who are not part of this group.\n In March 2020, an amount of \n!2.3\n million\n was paid out to the participants. \nNo further expenses were \nincurred \nfor this program in the year under review.\n ! \n  227 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2.0\n Ð \n2021" PROGRAM\n In 2018, the Long\n-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) "Game Changer 2.0" was launched. Participants in this \nprogram consist mainly of top executives reporting to th\ne Management Board and individual key positions \nin the PUMA Group. The objective of this program is to retain these employees in the Company on a long\n-term basis and to allow them to share in the medium\n-term success of the Company.\n The LTIP "Game Changer 2\n.0" consists of two plan parts, a Performance Cash Plan and a Performance \nShare Plan, each with a 50% share. The Performance Cash Plan gives a reward for PUMAÕs financial \nperformance, while the Performance Share Plan gives a reward for its performance in t\nhe capital market.\n The performance period of the Performance Cash Plan is three years and is based on the average medium\n-term targets of the PUMA Group for EBIT (70%), cash flow (15%) and net sales (15%). Payment is made in \n\ncash and is limited to a maximum\n of 200% of the granted proportionate target amount (cap).\n The Performance Share Plan uses virtual shares to manage the incentive. The term is up to five years, \n\ndivided into a three\n-year performance period and a subsequent, two\n-year exercise period, in whi\nch the \nvirtual shares are paid out in cash. A payout is only possible at the three exercise times (6, 12 or 18 months \nafter the end of the performance period). The average share price of the last 30 trading days before the \nexercise date determines the value of a virtual share. The payout is limited to a maximum of 200% of the \n\ngranted prorated target amount (cap) and is only performed if an exercise hurdle of +10% share\n-price \nappreciation was exceeded once during the performance period.\n The program is subjec\nt to the condition that the individual participant is in an unterminated employment \nrelationship with a company of the PUMA Group as of December 31, 2020. A prorated share of \n!1.0\n million\n was set aside as a provision for the "Game Changer 2.0 \nÐ \n2021" progr\nam during the reporting period and \n!0.4\n million\n was released.\n EXPLANATION OF THE "GAME CHANGER 2.0\n Ð \n2022" PROGRAM\n In 2019, the global "Game Changer 2.0\n Ð \n2022" program was launched, which is subject to the same \nparameters as the "Game Changer 2.0\n Ð \n2021" \nprogram (employment relationship until December 31, 2021 \nand payout March 2022).

However, as\n part of the Performance Share component, payment is limited to a \nmaximum of 300% of the granted proportionate target amount (cap).

MANAGEMENT OF THE CURRENCY RISK\n In \nthe financial year 2020, PUMA designated currency hedges as cash flow hedges in order to hedge the \namount payable of purchases denominated in USD, which is converted to euros, as well as for other \ncurrency risks resulting from internal resale to PUMA subsi\ndiaries.\n Furthermore, currency swaps and currency forward transactions are used to hedge foreign exchange risks \nwhen measuring intra\n-group loans denominated in foreign currencies.\n The nominal amounts of open exchange rate\n-hedging transactions, which relate\n mainly to cash flow \nhedges, refer primarily to currency forward transactions in a total amount of \n!3,026.5\n million\n (previous \nyear: \n!2,842.6\n million\n). These underlying transactions are expected to generate cash flows in 2021 and \n2022. \nFor further informati\non, please refer to the explanations in chapter 13.\n The market values of open exchange rate\n-hedging transactions on the balance sheet date consist of:\n !!T.61 \n(! million\n)  2020 2019 Currency hedging contracts, assets (see chapters 6 and 12)\n 26.1\n 46.5\n Currency hedging contracts, liabilities (see chapters 13 and 14)\n -135.2\n -38.2\n Net\n -109.1\n 8.3\n     The changes in effective cash flow hedges are shown in the schedule of changes in shareholdersÕ equity and \nthe statement of comprehensive income.\n ! \n  235 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n In \norder to disclose market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical \nchanges in relevant risk variables on earnings and equity. The periodic effects are determined by relating \nthe hypothetical changes caused by the ris\nk variables to the balance of the financial instruments held as of \nthe balance sheet date. The underlying assumption is that the balance as of the balance sheet date is \nrepresentative for the entire year.\n Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on \naccount of financial instruments that are denominated in a \ncurrency that is not the functional currency and are monetary in nature. Differences resulting from the \nconversion of the individual financial statements to the group currency are not taken into account. All non\n-functional currencies in which PUMA employs financial instruments are generally considered to be relevant \nrisk variables.\n Currency sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:\n Material non\n-derivative monetary financial instru\nments (cash and cash equivalents, receivables, interest\n-bearing debt, lease liabilities, non\n-interest\n-bearing liabilities) are either denominated directly in the \nfunctional currency or transferred into the functional currency through the use of currency he\ndging \ncontracts.\n \nCurrency hedging contracts used to hedge against payment fluctuations caused by exchange rates are part \nof an effective cash\n-flow hedging relationship pursuant to IAS 39. Changes in the exchange rate of the \ncurrencies underlying these cont\nracts have an effect on the hedge reserve in equity and the fair value of \nthese hedging contracts.\n If, as of December 31, 2020, the USD had appreciated (devalued) against all other currencies by 10%, the \nhedge reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging contracts would have been \n!151.9\n million\n higher \n(lower) (December 31, 2019: \n!150.6\n million\n higher (lower)).\n Currency risks and other risk and opportunity categories are discussed in greater detail in the Combined \nManagement Report in the Risk and O\npportunity Management section as well as in chapters 2 and 13 of the \nNotes to the consolidated financial statements.\n ! \n  236 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n 25. SEGMENT REPORTING \nSegment reporting is based on geographical regions in accordance with the PUMA internal repo\nrting \nstructure, apart from stichd. The geographical region forms the business segment. Sales revenue, the \noperating result (EBIT) and other segment information are allocated to the corresponding geographical \n\nregions according to the registered office of t\nhe respective Group company.\n  \nThe internal management reporting includes the following reporting segments: Europe, EEMEA (Eastern \n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa), North America, Latin America, Greater China, Rest of Asia/ Pacific \n\n(excluding Greater China) \nand stichd. These are reported as reportable business segments in accordance \n\nwith the criteria of IFRS 8.\n The reconciliation includes information on assets, liabilities, expenses and income in connection with \n\ncentralized functions that do not meet the defi\nnition of business segments in IFRS 8. Central expenses and \nincome include in particular central sourcing, central treasury, central marketing and other global \n\nfunctions of the Company headquarters.\n The CompanyÕs main decision\n-maker is defined as the entir\ne Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE. \nWith the exception of sales of goods by stichd amounting to \n!30.0\n million\n (previous year: \n!32.7\n million\n), there are no significant internal sales between the business segments, which are therefore not included in \n\nthe presentation.\n The operating result (EBIT) of the business segments is defined as gross profit less the attributable other \noperating expenses plus royalty and commission income and other operating income, but not considering \n\nthe costs of the central departments and\n the central marketing expenses.\n The external sales, operating result (EBIT), inventories and trade receivables of the business segments are \n\nregularly reported to the main decision\n-maker. Amounts recognized by the Group from the intra\n-group \nprofit eliminat\nion on inventories in connection with intra\n-group sales are not allocated to the business \nsegments in the way that they are reported to the main decision\n-maker. Investments, depreciation and non\n-current assets at the level of the business segments are not \nreported to the chief operating decision\n-maker. Intangible assets are allocated to the business segments in the manner described under chapter \n\n11. Segment liabilities, the financial result and income taxes are not allocated to the business segments \n\nand are\n therefore not reported to the chief operating decision\n-maker at the business segment level.\n Non\n-current assets and depreciation comprise the carrying amounts and depreciation of property, plant \nand equipment, right\n-of-use assets and intangible assets during the past financial year. \nThe investments \ncomprise additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n Since PUMA is active in only one business area, the sporting goods industry, products are additionally \n\nallocated according to the \nfootwear, apparel and accessories product segments in accordance with the \ninternal reporting structure.\n ! \n  237 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

NOTES TO THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n The cash flow statement was prepared in accordance with IAS 7 and is structured based on cash flows from \noperating, investment and financing activities. The indirect method is used to \ndetermine the cash \noutflow/inflow from ongoing operating activities. The gross cash flow, derived from earnings before income \ntax and adjusted for non\n-cash income and expense items, is determined within the cash flow from ongoing \noperating activities. Cash\n outflow/inflow from operating activities, reduced by investments in property, plant \nand equipment as well as intangible assets is referred to as free cash flow.\n The financial resource fund reported in the cash flow statement includes all payment methods a\nnd equivalent payment methods shown under ÒCash and cash equivalents,Ó i.e., cash in hand, checks and \n\ncurrent bank balances.\n The following table shows the cash and non\n-cash changes in financial liabilities in accordance with IAS \n7.44A:\n !!T.6\n5 \nRECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES TO THE CASH INFLOW/\n OUTFLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES \n2020 (! million\n)    Non\n-cash changes\n Cash changes\n   Notes\n As of \n Jan. 1, 2020\n Currency \nchanges\n Others\n As of\n Dec. 31, 2020\n Financial liabilities\n       Lease \nliabilities\n 10 745.3\n -60.5\n 381.8\n -135.0\n 931.7\n Current financial liabilities\n 13 10.2\n -1.3\n 0.0\n 112.5\n 121.4\n Non\n-current financial \nliabilities\n 13 163.3\n 0.0\n 0.0\n -18.3\n 145.0\n Total\n  918.8\n -61.7\n 381.8\n -40.7\n 1,198.1\n         ! \n  241 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

DISCLOSURES RELATED TO NON\n-CONTROLLING INTERESTS\n The summarized financial information about subsidiaries of the Group in which non\n-controlling interests \nexist is presented below. This financial information relates to all companies with non\n-controlling interests \nin which the identical non\n-controlling shareholder holds an interest. The figures represent the amounts \nbefore intercompany eliminations.\n Evaluation of the control of companies with non\n-controlling interests:\n The Group holds a 51% capital share in PUMA United North America LLC, PUMA United Canada ULC and \n\nJaned Canada LLC (inactive company). With these companies, there are profit\n-sharing arrangements in \nplace which differ from the capital share for the benefit o\nf the respective identical non\n-controlling \nshareholder. PUMA receives higher license fees in exchange.\n The contractual agreements with these companies respectively provide for PUMA a majority of the voting \n\nrights at the shareholder meetings and thus the ri\nght of disposal regarding these companies. PUMA is \nexposed to fluctuating returns from the turnover\n-based license fees and controls the relevant activities of \nthese companies. The companies are accordingly included in the consolidated financial statements \nas subsidiaries with full consolidation with recognition of the shares of non\n-controlling interests.\n The share of non\n-controlling interests existing on the balance sheet date relates to PUMA United North \nAmerica LLC, PUMA United Canada ULC and Janed Canada\n, LLC (inactive) with \n!41.5\n million\n (previous \nyear: \n!46.7\n million\n). ! \n  243 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

MANAGEMENT BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD\n Disclosures pursuant to Section 314 \n(1) No. 6 HGB (German Commercial Code [Handelsgesetzbuch])\n Pursuant to Sections 286 (5), 314 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, the publication of the individual remuneration of the \nmembers of the Management Board in accordance with Section 285 No. 9 a) Sentences 5 to 8 \nand Section \n314 (1) No. 6 a) Sentences 5 to 8 HGB may be waived for five years if the Annual General Meeting so \n\nresolves.\n By resolution of the Annual General Meeting on April 12, 2018, the Company was authorized to waive the \n\ndisclosure requirements pursuan\nt to Section 285 No. 9 a) Sentences 5 to 8 and Section 314 (1) No. 6 a) \nSentences 5 to 9 of the German Commercial Code for the financial year beginning January 1, 2018 and for \n\nall subsequent financial years ending December 31, 2022 at the latest.\n The Super\nvisory Board is of the opinion that the shareholders\' legitimate interest in information is \nsufficiently taken into account by disclosing the total remuneration of the members of the Management \n\nBoard. \nIn accordance with its statutory obligations, the Super\nvisory Board will ensure the appropriateness \nof individual remuneration.\n COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY\n The Management Board compensation system is designed to create incentives for a sustainable and profit\n-oriented company performance. The objective of the compensation system is to stimulate the \nimplementation of long\n-term Group strategy by ensuring that th\ne relevant success parameters that govern \nthe performance\n-based compensation are aligned with the \nPUMA\n SE management system. Furthermore, \nthe long\n-term interests of our shareholders are taken into account by making the variable compensation \nstrongly depend\nent on the performance of the \nPUMA\n SE share.\n With a greater share of performance\n-based and therefore variable compensation, the intention is to reward \nthe contribution of our Management Board members towards a sustainable development of our Company, \n\nwhile \nnegative deviations from the set targets will result in a significant reduction of variable compensation.\n An updated Management Board compensation system that complies with the requirements of the German \n\nAct Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Direc\ntive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der zweiten \nAktion−rsrechterichtlinie, ARUG II) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code \n\nas amended on December 16, 2019 is to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval on May 5, \n2021. GOVERNA\nNCE IN COMPENSATION MATTERS\n It is the responsibility of the \nPUMA\n SE Supervisory Board to determine the compensation of the \nManagement Board. The entire Supervisory Board decides on matters relating to the compensation of the \nManagement Board members based on the respective recommendations of the Personnel Committee \n\nwhich i\ns comprised of members of the Supervisory Board. Criteria for calculating the total compensation \nare the responsibilities and performance of the individual Management Board member, the economic \n\nsituation of \nPUMA\n SE, \nlong\n-term strategic planning and related\n goals, the sustainability of targeted results \nand the CompanyÕs long\n-term prospects.\n ! \n  245 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial \nStatements\n OVERVIEW OF COMPENSATION ELEMENTS\n The compensation of the Management Board consists of non\n-performance\n-based and performance\n-based \ncomponents. The non\n-performance\n-based\n components comprise the basic compensation, company \npension contributions and other fringe benefits, while the performance\n-based components are divided into \ntwo parts, a bonus and a component with long\n-term incentive effect:\n !!G.01 TARGET COMPENSATION STRUCTURE\n  CHANGE IN COMPENSATION COMPONENTS IN 2020 DUE TO THE COVID\n-19 PANDEMIC AND LOAN \nCOMMITMENTS FROM KFW BANKENGRUPPE\n At the beginning of the COVID\n-19 pandemic in March 2020, all members of the Management Board of \nPUMA\n SE voluntarily waived their respec\ntive basic compensation for the months of April and May 2020 to \nshow solidarity with those employees of PUMA for whom short\n-time work was applied for and with other \nemployees who also forwent part of their remuneration for the months of April and May 2020.\n For the same \nreason, all members of the Supervisory Board also waived part of their annual compensation.\n In addition, all members of the Management Board waived their respective bonus payment for the financial \nyear 2020, including the bonus for the indivi\ndual performance of members of the Management Board. The \nManagement Board thus complied with a requirement for the granting of a loan with the participation of \nKfW Bankengruppe. Nevertheless, provisions of \n!1.9\n million\n were set up in the financial year 2020 for a \nlong\n-term incentive program in 2020 on account of individual contractual obligations toward the members \nof the Management Board. In 2021, the Supervisory Board will decide on the provision of a long\n-term \nincentive program for the financial year 2020 and will grant an allocation only on the condition that doing so \nis in compliance with the requirements of KfW Bankengruppe.\n ! \n  246 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n TARGET COMPENSATION STRUCTURE\n NON\n-PERFORMANCE\n-BASED COMPENSATION AND FRINGE BENEFITS\n Basi\nc Compensation\n The members of the Management Board receive a fixed basic salary which is paid monthly. This salary is \nbased on the duties and responsibilities of the member of the Management Board. For employment periods \nof less than twelve months in a calendar year, all compensation payments are paid on a prorated basis. \nFor \n\nthe months of April and May 2020, the members of the Management Board voluntarily waived their basic \n\ncompensation.\n Fringe Benefits\n In addition, the Management Board members receive in\n-kind compensation, such as use of company cars, \naccident insurance and D&amp;O insurance. \nThese are part of the non\n-performance\n-based compensation.\n Company \nPension\n Pension benefits are available for the members of the Management Board in the form of deferred \n\ncompensation paid out of the performance\n-based and/or the non\n-performance\n-based compensation, for \nwhich the Company has taken out pension liability insurance. The proportion of the pension capital that is \n\nalready financed through contributions to the pensio\nn liability insurance is deemed to be vested.\n Performance\n-based\n Compensation\n In addition to the non\n-performance\n-based compensation, the members of the Management Board receive \nperformance\n-based and therefore variable compensation. The amount of this compen\nsation is based on the \nattainment of previously defined financial and non\n-financial targets. It consists of a bonus and a component \nwith a long\n-term incentive effect. In the event of any outstanding performance, the Supervisory Board may, \nat its discretion\n, grant the members of the Management Board a voluntary one\n-off payment.\n Short\n-term variable \nCompensation\n Ñ \nBonus\n All members of the Management Board waived short\n-term variable compensation for the financial year \n2020.  \nHowever, the short\n-term variable com\npensation system as it would have been applied if the Management \nBoard had not waived it in 2020 is described below for the sake of completeness.\n As part of the performance\n-based compensation, the bonus is primarily based on the financial goals of the \noperating result (EBIT) and free cash flow (FCF) of the PUMA Group and the individual performance of the \nrespective Management Board member as well as the attainment of Group\n-wide sustainability targets. The \ntwo financial success targets are weighted with 60% \nfor EBIT and 20%, respectively, for FCF. The individual \n\nperformance is included in the calculation with a weighting of 15%. The degree to which the sustainability \ntargets have been achieved is taken into account in the calculation with a weighting of 5%. \nIf 100% of the \ntarget is achieved ("target bonus"), the amount of the bonus is 100% of the annual basic compensation for \nthe Chair of the Management Board and the Management Board members.\n The aforementioned performance targets are combined. For EBIT, \nFCF and the sustainability targets, the \nbandwidth of possible target attainments ranges from 0% to 150%. It is therefore possible that no short\n-term variable compensation at all is paid out if minimum targets are not attained.\n  \n! \n  247 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n !!G.02 STI-PLAN  An \nidentical target attainment curve has been created, respectively, for the two financial goals. If the budget \ntarget for EBIT or FCF is reached, the target attainment is 100% (target value). If EBIT/FCF are less than \n95% of the target value, this results in\n a target attainment of 0%. If EBIT/FCF reach 95% of the target value, \nthe target attainment is 50%. If EBIT/FCF reach 120% or more of the target value, the target attainment is \nlimited to 150% (maximum value). Target attainments between the determined tar\nget attainment points are \ninterpolated. This results in the following target attainment curve for the EBIT and FCF performance \n\ntargets:\n !!G.03 TARGET ATTAINMENT CURVE EBIT/FCF\n  Individual Performance \nTarget\n Attainment\n The Supervisory Board assesses the indi\nvidual performance of the Management Board member based on \npreviously defined criteria, such as sustainable leadership, strategic vision and good corporate governance. \nThe Supervisory Board determines target criteria for assessing individual performance ev\nery year. At the \nend of the performance period, the Supervisory Board evaluates the degree of attainment of the target \ncriteria. Target attainment can be between 0% and 150%.\n ! \n  248 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n Target Attainment \nSustainability\n Targets\n The sustainability targets include goa\nls to reduce CO\n2 emissions, compliance targets and occupational \nhealth and safety objectives. They are applied throughout the PUMA Group and measured quantitatively on \na standardized basis. The Supervisory Board determines four target criteria for calculating the \nsustaina\nbility targets every year. At the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board evaluates the \n\ndegree of attainment of the target criteria. Target attainment can be between 0% and 150%.\n Long-term variable share\n-based \ncompensation\n In the financial yea\nr 2020, no long\n-term variable compensation was granted to members of the \nManagement Board. The Supervisory Board thus complied with a requirement for the granting of a loan \n\nwith the participation of KfW Bankengruppe. Nevertheless, provisions of \n!1.9\n millio\nn \nwere set up in the \nfinancial year 2020 for a long\n-term incentive program in 2020 on account of individual contractual \nobligations toward the members of the Management Board. In 2021, the Supervisory Board will decide on \n\nthe provision of a long\n-term incentive program for the financial year 2020 and will grant an allocation only \non the condition that doing so is in compliance with the requirements of KfW Bankengruppe. The long\n-term \nincentive program then to be granted will be in line with the compensation s\nystem that will be presented for \n\napproval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.\n Rules for \nTerminating\n Management Board Activity and other Contractual Provisions\n In the event of a temporary disablement due to illness, the Management Board member retains h\nis or her \nentitlement to full contractual compensation up to a total duration of six months but for no longer than the \n\nend of the employment contract. The Management Board member must offset payments received from \n\nhealth insurance companies or pension insu\nrances in the form of sick pay or pension benefits against the \ncompensation payments, insofar as these benefits are not fully based on contributions by the Management \n\nBoard member.\n In the case of an early termination of the employment contract without good\n cause within the meaning of \nsection 626 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB), any payments to be agreed to the Management Board \n\nmember, including fringe benefits, will not exceed the amount of two annual compensations (severance \n\ncap) and must not exceed the\n value of the compensation for the remaining duration of the Management \nBoard employment contract. The calculation of the severance cap is based on the total compensation of the \n\npast financial year and also on any expected total compensation for the curren\nt financial year. In the event \nof an early termination of the employment contract before the end of the relevant performance period for \n\nthe bonus and/or the three\n-year vesting period of the long\n-term variable compensation, the contract makes \nno provision f\nor an early payout of the variable compensation components. If the member of the \nManagement Board becomes permanently disabled during the term of the employment contract, the \n\ncontract is terminated on the day on which the permanent disability is determined\n. A permanent disability \nexists within the meaning of this provision, if the member of the Management Board is no longer able, due \nto illness or accident, to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to him or her. \nIn this respect, the specific duties \nand part\nicular responsibility of the member of the Management Board must be taken into account.\n If the member of the Management Board dies during the term of the employment contract, his or her widow \n\nor widower and children, provided they have not yet reached the age of 27, are entitled as joint creditors to \n\nreceive the unreduced continued payment of the fixed compensation for the month in which the death \n\noccurred and for the six following months, but for no longer than up to the end of the regular term of the \ncont\nract.\n ! \n  249 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

During the \nfinancial year, PUMA allocated \n!0.4\n million\n for members of the Management Board (previous year: \n!0.4\n million\n). The present value of the pension benefits granted to active Management Board members of \n\n  250 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n !13.0\n million\n as of December 31, 2020 (previous year: \n!10.8\n million\n) was netted against the equally \nhigh \nand pledged asset value of the pension liability insurance on the balance sheet. The majority of the present \nvalue is attributable to the pension benefits financed by deferred compensation.\n COMPENSATION FOR FORMER MANAGEMENT BOARD MEMBERS\n In the repor\nting year, \n!0.8\n million\n was spent on pro\n-rata basic compensation, pro\n-rata fringe benefits and \nshort\n-term and long\n-term variable compensation for former members of the Management Board.\n There were pension obligations to former members of the Management Boa\nrd and their widows/widowers \namounting to \n!3.2\n million\n (previous year: \n!3.3\n million\n) as well as contribution\n-based pension commitments \nin connection with the deferred compensation of former members of the Management Board and Managing \nDirectors amounting t\no !11.3\n million\n (previous year: \n!11.6\n million\n). Both items were recognized as \nliabilities within pension provisions to the extent they were not offset against asset values of an equal \n\namount. \nPension obligations to former members of the Management Board an\nd their widows/widowers \nwere incurred amounting to \n!0.2\n million\n (previous year: \n!0.2\n million\n). SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPENSATION SYSTEM\n In the reporting year, all members of the Supervisory Board waived part of their annual compensation. The \n\nfollowing describ\nes the Supervisory Board compensation system if no components are waived.\n The Supervisory Board compensation system has been changed to purely fixed compensation. The Articles \n\nof Association were amended following the shareholders\' decision at the Annual General Meeting on May 7, \n\n2020. As for the Management Board, the relevant criteria for calculating the compensation are the \n\nresponsibilities and performance of the individual Supervisory Board member, the economic situation of \nPUMA\n SE, \nthe long\n-term strateg\nic planning and related goals, the sustainability of achieved results and the \nCompanyÕs long\n-term prospects. For this reason, the Supervisory Board compensation consists of a fixed, \nnon-performance\n-based amount.\n The Supervisory Board compensation conforms \nto ¤ 15 of the Articles of Association, according to which \neach Supervisory Board member receives a fixed annual compensation of \n!25,000.00. This amount is \npayable after the Annual General Meeting for the respective financial year. In addition to the fixed\n, annual \ncompensation, the members of the Supervisory Board are entitled to an increase of their fixed \ncompensation based on their position on the board and their membership of committees. The Chair of the \n\nSupervisory Board and the Vice Chair receive an ad\nditional fixed annual amount of \n!25,000.00 and \n!12,500.00, respectively. The chair of a committee additionally receives \n!10,000.00, and the members of a \ncommittee \n!5,000.00, respectively. The respective committees are the Personnel Committee, the Audit \nCom\nmittee and the Sustainability Committee.\n A member of the Supervisory Board who is only active for part of a financial year receives prorated \n\nremuneration calculated on the basis of the period of activity determined for full months.\n ! \n  251 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS\n In accordance with IAS 24, relationships to related companies and persons that control or are controlled by \nthe PUMA Group must be reported. All natural persons and companies that \ncan be controlled by PUMA, that \ncan exercise relevant control over the PUMA Group or that are under the relevant control of another related \n\nparty of the PUMA Group are considered as related companies or persons within the meaning of IAS 24.\n As of December \n31, 2020, there was one shareholding in \nPUMA\n SE that exceeded 10% of the voting rights. \nThis is held by the Pinault family via several companies that the family controls (in order of proximity to the \nPinault family: Financi‘re Pinault S.C.A., Art”mis S.A.S\n. and Kering S.A.). The shareholding of Kering S.A. in \nPUMA\n SE amounts to 9.8% of share capital according to KeringÕs press release from October 6, 2020. \nTogether, Art”mis S.A.S. and Kering S.A. hold 38.4% of the share capital. Since Art”mis S.A.S. and Ker\ning \nS.A. hold more than 20% of the voting rights in \nPUMA\n SE, \nthey are presumed to have significant influence \naccording to IAS 28.6. They and all other companies directly or indirectly controlled by Art”mis S.A.S. that \nare not included in the consolidated f\ninancial statements of \nPUMA\n SE are considered as related parties in \nthe following.\n  \nIn addition, the disclosure obligation pursuant to IAS 24 extends to transactions with associated companies \nas well as transactions with other related companies and \npersons. These include non\n-controlling \nshareholders in particular.\n Transactions with related companies and persons largely concern the sale of goods and services. These \nwere concluded under normal market conditions that are also customary with third partie\ns. ! \n  252 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

As in the previous year, no expenses we\nre recorded in \nthis respect in the financial year 2020.\n Classification of the remuneration of key management personnel in accordance with IAS 24.17:\n The members of key management personnel in accordance with IAS 24 are the Management Board and the \nSupervis\nory Board. These are counted as related parties.\n In the financial year 2020, the expenses for key management personnel of \nPUMA\n SE for short\n-term benefits \namounted to \n!2.7\n million\n (previous year: \n!5.9\n million\n) and for share\n-based compensation \n!0.0\n million\n (previous year: \n!3.9\n million\n). In addition, no expenses were incurred for other long\n-term benefits or for \nbenefits due to the termination of employment in the reporting year (previous year: \n!0.5\n million\n). Accordingly, total expenses for the reporting year a\nmount to \n!2.7\n million\n (previous year: \n!10.3\n million\n).

Consolidated Financial Statements\n INDEPENDENT AUDITORÕS REPORT\n To PUMA\n SE, \nHerzogenaurach/Germany\n REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE \nCOMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n AUDIT OPINIONS\n We have audited the consolidated financial statements of \nPUMA\n SE, \nHerzogenaurach/Germany, and its \nsubsidiaries\n (ÒPUMAÓ or Òthe GroupÓ) which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December \n2020, and the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the \nconsolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated s\ntatement of cash flows for the financial \nyear from 1 January to 31 December 2020, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including \n\na summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the combined management \n\nreport for the parent and the group (Òcombined management reportÓ) of \nPUMA\n SE, \nHerzogenaurach/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. In accordance with \n\nthe German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the consolidated c\norporate governance \nstatement included in the section ÒCorporate governance statement in accordance with Section 289f and \n\nSection 315d German Commercial Code (HGB)Ó of the combined management report.\n In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained i\nn the audit,\n ¥!the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements \nof German commercial law pursuant to Section \n315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these \nrequirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at \n\n31 December 2020 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December \n\n2020, and \n ¥!the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the GroupÕs \nposition. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated \nfinancial statements, complies with German \nlegal requirements and appropriately presents the \nopportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report \n\ndoes not cover the content of the consolidated corporate governance statement included in the section \n\nÒCorp\norate governance statement in accordance with Section 289f and Section 315d German \nCommercial Code (HGB)Ó of the combined management report.\n  Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations \nrelating to \nthe legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management \nreport.\n BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS\n We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report \nin accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as \nÒEU Audit RegulationÓ) and in compliance with Ge\nrman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial \nStatement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those \n\nrequirements and principles are further described in the ÒAuditorÕs Responsibilities for the Audit of\n the \nConsolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management ReportÓ section of our auditorÕs \n\nreport. \nWe are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and \nGerman commercial and professional law, and we h\nave fulfilled our other German professional \n\n  263 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point \n(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non\n-audit services prohibited unde\nr Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and \n\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the \n\ncombined management report.\n KEY AUDI\nT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our \n\naudit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. \nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a \nwhole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these \n\nmatters.\n In the following we pres\nent the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:\n 1. Recoverability of goodwill\n 2. Recoverability of the Cobra brand\n Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\n a) Description (including reference to c\norresponding information in the consolidated financial \nstatements)\n b) AuditorÕs response\n 1. RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL\n a) The consolidated financial statements of \nPUMA\n SE show goodwill in the amount of mEUR 241.5 \ncorresponding to approximately 5.2% of the consolidated balance sheet total or 13.7% of the group equity.\n Each financial year or in case of signs of impairment, goodwill is subject to impairment tests. The \nimpairment tests are performed by \nPUMA\n SE applying the Òdiscounted cash flow methodÓ. The valuations \nare based on the present values of the future cash flow\ns which are in turn based on the three\n-year plan \n(detailed planning horizon) valid at the date of the impairment test. This detailed planning horizon is \n\nsubsequently extended assuming long\n-term growth rates. Discounting is performed using the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC). Here, the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the value in use \n\nand a possible need for impairment is determined by comparing the value in use with the carrying amount.\n The outcome of this valuation highly depends on\n the executive directorsÕ assessment of future cash inflows, \nthe long\n-term growth rates as well as the WACC rates applied for discounting and therefore involves uncer\n-tainties and discretion. Thus, the assessment of the recoverability of the goodwill was c\nlassified as a key \naudit matter within the scope of our audit.\n Information on the goodwill, provided by the executive directors, is disclosed in chapter 2 ÒSignificant \nconsolidation, accounting and valuation principlesÓ and in chapter 11 ÒIntangible assets\nÓ of the notes to the \nconsolidated financial statements.\n b) Within the scope of our risk\n-based audit approach, we particularly gained an understanding of the \nsystematic approach applied when performing the impairment tests. We satisfied ourselves, that the\n valuation model used adequately presents the requirements of the relevant standards, whether the \nnecessary input data are completely and accurately determined and taken over and whether the \ncalculations within the model are performed correctly. We assured\n ourselves of the appropriateness of the \nfuture cash inflows used for the computation by particularly reconciling these cash flows with the current \n\nthree\n-year plan, as well as by interviewing the executive directors or persons appointed by them with \n\n  264 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n regard\n to the material assumptions underlying this plan. In addition, we performed a critical assessment of \nthe plan under consideration of general and industry\n-specific market expectations.\n Since a material portion of the respective value in use results from th\ne forecast cash inflows for the period \nafter the three\n-year planning horizon (phase of perpetuity), we in particular performed a critical \nassessment of the sustainable growth rate used within the perpetuity phase by means of general and \n\nindustry\n-specific m\narket expectations. Since relatively low changes of the discount rate used may already \nhave a material effect on the amount of the recoverable amount, we also validated the parameters used for \n\ndetermining the discount rate (WACC = weighted average cost of \ncapital) involving internal experts from the \nfinancial advisory sector and reproduced the computation scheme.\n Due to the possibly material significance and taking into account the fact that the valuation of the goodwill \n\nalso depends on the economic framewo\nrk conditions that cannot be influenced by the Group, we \n\nadditionally performed a critical assessment of the sensitivity analyses performed by \nPUMA\n SE for the \ncash-generating units (CGUs) with low headroom (present values compared to the carrying amount) i\nn order to be able to assess a possible impairment risk in case of change of a material valuation assumption.\n 2. RECOVERABILITY OF THE COBRA BRAND\n a) For the Cobra brand, the consolidated financial statements of \nPUMA\n SE disclose a brand value in the \namount\n of mEUR 115.9 with an indefinite useful life, which corresponds to approximately 2.5% of the \nconsolidated balance sheet total or 6.6% of the group equity.\n The Cobra brand is subject to an impairment test conducted annually or in case of a triggering event\n. The \nimpairment test is conducted by \nPUMA\n SE based on the relief from royalty method. According to this \napproach, the value of the brand results from future royalties that a company would have to pay for the use \n\nof the brand if they had to license it. \nThe approach uses forecast revenue generated from the Cobra brand \n\nbased on the effective three\n-year plan (detailed planning horizon) valid at the time the impairment test is \nconducted. This detailed planning horizon is subsequently extended assuming long\n-t\nerm growth rates. \nDiscounting is performed using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Here, the recoverable amount \n\nis determined on the basis of the value in use and a possible need for impairment is determined by \ncomparing the value in use with th\ne carrying amount. If there are indications of impairment of the brand \nused by the Group itself, the recoverability of the brand is evaluated by reference to the recoverable amount \nof the cash\n-generating unit to which the brand is allocated.\n The outcome of\n this valuation highly depends on the executive directorsÕ assessment of the future revenue \ngenerated from the Cobra brand, the royalty rate, the long\n-term growth rate as well as the WACC rate \napplied for discounting and therefore involves uncertainties an\nd discretion. Thus, the recoverability of the \nCobra brand was classified as key audit matter within the scope of our audit.\n Information on the Cobra brand, provided by the executive directors, is disclosed in chapter 2 ÒSignificant \n\nconsolidation, accountin\ng and valuation principlesÓ and in chapter 11 ÒIntangible assetsÓ of the notes to the \nconsolidated financial statements.\n b) As part of our risk\n-based audit approach, we first examined on the basis of the information available to \nus and in discussions with \nthe executive directors and with persons appointed by them, that there are no \nindications of impairment of the brand used by the Group itself and that the recoverability of the brand can \nbe assessed separately by use of the relief\n-from\n-royalty method as part of the impairment test. We have \nfollowed the methodological procedure for performing the impairment test using the relief\n-from\n-royalty \nmethod. In this regard, we examined, whether the valuation model adequately reflects the conceptual \n\nrequirements of th\ne relevant standards, whether the necessary input data are completely and accurately \ndetermined and whether the calculations applied to the model are made correctly. We satisfied ourselves of \nthe appropriateness of the assumed future revenue (Cobra branded\n sales) on which the computation is \nbased by reconciling these sales particularly with the effective three\n-year plan as well as by interviewing \nthe executive directors and persons appointed by them with regard to the material assumptions underlying \nthis pl\nan. \nIn addition, we performed a critical assessment of the plan under consideration of general and \n\n  265 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n industry\n-specific market expectations. Since a material portion of the value in use results from the forecast \nrevenue for the period following the three\n-year\n plan (phase of perpetuity), we particularly reviewed the \nsustainable growth rate applied to the perpetuity phase by means of general and industry\n-specific market \nexpectations. As even relatively small changes of the expected royalty rate and the used discount rate may \nhave a material effect on the value in use, we also assessed the parameters involved in the assumed royalty \n\nrate and determination of the discount rate involving internal valuation experts from the financial advisory \n\nsector and recalculated t\nhe computation scheme. We critically assessed the used royalty rate by based on \naverage industry rates.\n Due to the potential material significance and as the measurement of the brand also depends on general \n\neconomic conditions that are beyond the GroupÕs control, we additionally critically assessed the sensitivity \n\nanalyses concerning the Cobra brand conducted by \nPUMA\n SE in order to be able to determine a potential \nimpairment risk in case a material assumption underlying the measurement changes.\n OTHER INFORMATION\n The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other \ninformation comprises:\n ¥!the report of the supervisory board,\n ¥!the consolidated corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 315d HGB included i\nn the section \nÒCorporate governance statement in accordance with Section 289f and Section 315d German \nCommercial Code (HGB)Ó of the combined management report,\n ¥!the executive directorsÕ confirmation pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1)\n sentence \n5 HGB, respectively, regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management \n\nreport,\n ¥!the separate combined non\n-financial statement which will be published after the issuance of this \nauditorÕs report, and\n ¥!all other parts of the\n annual report which will be published after the issuance of this auditorÕs report, \n ¥!but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the group management report \nand not our auditorÕs report thereon.\n  The supervisory board is respo\nnsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and \nthe supervisory board as well are responsible for the declaration according to Section 161 German Stock \nCorporation Act (AktG), which is part of the corporate governance statement \npursuant to Section 289f and \nSection 315d HGB included in the section ÒCorporate governance statement in accordance with Section 289f \nand Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB)Ó of the combined management report. Otherwise, the \nexecutive directors are responsible for the other information.\n Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do \n\nnot cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of \n\nassurance conclusion thereon.\n ! \n  266 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information stated above and, in so \ndoing, to consider whether the other information\n ¥!is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial \nstatements, with the audited content of the \ncombined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n ¥!otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FOR THE \nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that \ncomply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the addition\nal requirements of German \ncommercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in \n\ncompliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and \n\nfinancial perform\nance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal \ncontrol as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements \n\nthat are free from material misstatement, whether due to frau\nd or error.\n In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing \nthe GroupÕs ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as \napplicable, matters related to go\ning concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based \n\non the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease \n\noperations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n Furthermore\n, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management \nreport that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the GroupÕs position and is, in all material respects, \nconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, co\nmplies with German legal requirements, and \nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive \ndirectors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered \n\nnecessary to enab\nle the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the \napplicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the \n\nassertions in the combined management report.\n The supervisory board is\n responsible for overseeing the GroupÕs financial reporting process for the \npreparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n AUDITORÕS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF\n THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as \na whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined \n\nmanagement report \nas a whole provides an appropriate view of the GroupÕs position and, in all material \nrespects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, \n\ncomplies with the German legal requirements and appropriately p\nresents the opportunities and risks of \n\nfuture development, as well as to issue an auditorÕs report that includes our audit opinions on the \n\nconsolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n Reasonable assurance is a high level of assu\nrance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in \naccordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally \nAccepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprfer\n (IDW) \nwill always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \n\neconomic decisions of users taken on the bas\nis of these consolidated financial statements and this \ncombined management report.\n ! \n  267 Annual Report\n 2020     \n! Consolidated Financial Statements\n We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n ¥!identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consoli\ndated financial statements and of \nthe combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \n\nfor our audit op\ninions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher \nthan for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \n\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n ¥!obtain an \nunderstanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements \nand of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to \n\ndesign audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum\nstances, but not for the purpose of expressing \n\nan audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n ¥!evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the \n\nreasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors a\nnd related disclosures.\n ¥!conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directorsÕ use of the going concern basis of accounting \nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast \nsignificant doubt on the GroupÕs ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditorÕs report to \n\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in\n the combined management report \nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are \n\nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorÕs report. However, future events or \nconditions may cause\n the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n ¥!evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, \nincluding the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the under\nlying \ntransactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view \n\nof the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with \n\nIFRS as adopted by the EU and with the a\ndditional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to \nSection 315e (1) HGB.\n ¥!obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business \n\nactivities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the \n\ncombined management report. \nWe are respon\nsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the \ngroup audit. \nWe remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n ¥!evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial \nstatements, its conformity with German \nlaw, and the view of the GroupÕs position it provides.\n ¥!perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the \ncombined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in \n\nparticular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective \ninformation, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. \n\nWe do not express a separate audit opinion on the pro\nspective information and on the assumptions used \nas a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the \n\nprospective information.\n  \nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matte\nrs, the planned scope \nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal \n\ncontrol that we identify during our audit.\n We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied\n with the relevant \nindependence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may \n\nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n From the matters communicated with those c\nharged with governance, we determine those matters that \nwere of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are \n\ntherefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditorÕs report unless \nlaw or regulation \nprecludes public disclosure about the matter.\n \n  268 Annual Report\n 2020     \n!

We \nall hope that we will quickly achieve the herd immunity that will \n \nallow us to live with the virus \nas a result of the vaccination \nprogrammes. It is already very \nclear that the pandemic will \nchange our lives. One positive \naspect is that we will all travel \nless on business, since we have \nlearned that many meetings \ncan also be held as video-\nconferences. This can help re\n-duce carbon emissions caused \nby business trips Œ a positive \ncontribution to combating \nthe  \nclimate crisis, if only a \nsmall one. \nFurther efforts are needed. \nClimate change is a serious \nthreat and one that we, as \n \ninsurers, have to be address in \ngreat \n detail in our risk \n \nmodelling, investment policy, \n \noperations and underwriting, \namong  other things. The \n \nchallenge is to find the right \nbalance between all our stakeholders™ interests. \nThis is why we are systemically implementing our end\n-to\n-end  \nsustainability strategy in our operations, our underwriting and our \nasset management, as well as with respect to our social commitment. \nOur new remuneration system \nfor the Board of Management \n \nrewards good leadership and \ndefines contributions to be \nmade by the individual Board \nmembers to our sustainability \nstrategy. This underlines our \nambitions.\nIn our operations, we are push\n-ing forward with our goal of \nachieving Group\n-wide climate \nneutrality by 2030 at the lat\n-est. We have already done this \nin Germany, where more than \n45 percent of our workforce is \nemployed. \nIn our underwriting, we are \ncontinuously expanding our \nESG approach and are paying \nparticular attention to the \nPrinciples for Sustainable In\n-surance (PSI). We have set our\n-selves the goal of exiting busi\n-ness models based on coal and oil sands by 2038 at the latest.

At the same time, we are \naiming to be a leading insurer in the renewables area.\nWe are also making significant progress in asset management and are \ncreating transparency in this area by joining the Principles for \n \nResponsible Investment (PRI) investor initiative: our new climate \nstrategy for investment is a major milestone in our sustainability \n \nactivities. As part of this, we determined the emissions for our invest\n-ment portfolio for the first time, in line with the Paris Agreement™s \nclimate goals. Our objective is to achieve a 30% reduction in the car\n-bon intensity of our liquid portfolio by 2025 compared to the begin\n-ning of 2020. This current target is an important step \n towards devel\n-oping a sustainable, long\n-term path towards carbon neutrality by \n2050. Our commitment to the Paris Agreement on \n climate change \nunderscores our objective. In addition, our investments are support\n-ing the transition towards green energy: the Talanx Group has invest\n-ed roughly EUR 3.7 billion in infrastructure, half of it in wind turbines. \nIn the current financial year, we have created the new position of a \nDiversity &amp; Inclusion Manager. Her role is to develop a Group\n-wide \ndiversity strategy and she reports directly to the Talanx Board of \nManagement member responsible for this.\nDear readers, discussions of environmental and social aspects and \nsustainable corporate governance are developing dynamically.

The Reinsurance Division consists of the Proper\n-ty/Casualty Reinsurance and Life/Health Reinsurance segments; \nthese are operated by Hannover Re SE.\nThe Group has assigned Talanx AG, which primarily has a strategic \nrole, to the Corporate Operations Segment. The Company has had a \nreinsurance license since January 2019 and is also engaged in opera\n-tional business. In addition, Corporate Operations comprises the \nGroup™s internal service companies and the reinsurance broker Talanx \nReinsurance Broker GmbH. Ampega Asset Management GmbH, \n \nAmpega Investment GmbH and Ampega Real Estate GmbH mainly \nprovide support for the Group™s investments and offer financial \n \nservices, among other things.\nThe Group™s key brands include both Talanx and the brand HDI.

For reasons of clarity, the \n \ndiagram concentrates on the operational aspects of the insurance \nbusiness. In addition, the Group provides other services, such as \n \nrecommending and implementing loss prevention measures, rein\n-surance advice and intermediation, and claims management services. \nTHE TALANX GROUP™S VALUE CHAIN\nThe Talanx Group requires production inputs, which are shown in \nthe diagram under ﬁInputﬂ, to produce insurance cover and other ser\n-vices. Apart from operating materials and capital, the main inputs are \nservices, such as the labour provided by the workforce and reinsur\n-ance capacity. Other suppliers of services include, for example, \n \nappraisers and claims handlers, refurbishment companies, waste dis\n-posal companies and lawyers. Suppliers that act as intermediaries for \ninsurance products (the ﬁOutputﬂ) are shown separately under ﬁInter\n-mediariesﬂ.\nThe value chain for the insurance business has a few features not \nfound in other sectors. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the \nﬁproductﬂ, insurance protection, is the result of a number of simulta\n-neous or successive internal and customer\n-related processes. Anoth\n-er unique aspect is that insurance clients contribute to the produc\n-tion process, for example because policyholders have to provide \ninformation or are involved in claims processing (see Dieter Farny, \n1989, ﬁVersicherungsbetriebslehreﬂ (ﬁInsurance Managementﬂ), Ver\n-lag Versicherungswirtschaft, Karlsruhe, page 133).\nThe different production stages at the Talanx Group are modelled us\n-ing the following five steps: ﬁproduct developmentﬂ, ﬁmarketing &amp; \nsalesﬂ, ﬁunderwritingﬂ, ﬁcustomer &amp; contract servicesﬂ and ﬁclaims \nmanagementﬂ. Group functions and departments contribute to im\n-plementing these steps. The Hannover Re Group largely has its own \nfunctions and structures. \nA clear distinction cannot always be made between the individual \nproduction stages, players and outputs, especially since there are dif\n-ferences between the divisions. For example, in industrial insurance \nand reinsurance, rates are set in the course of the underwriting pro\n-cess, whereas in retail insurance this is done by the product develop\n-ment function. ﬁCustomer &amp; contract servicesﬂ generally refers to the \nmanagement of written insurance policies.

In particular, working from \n home is current dominating ideas of ﬁNew Workﬂ. A \nNewWork@HDI task force in Germany is currently devel\n-oping suggestions about what the world of work might \nlook like at Talanx once the coronavirus pandemic is over. \nIts mandate is to create a framework for organising work \nin the future that is more mobile, more flexible and more \nhybrid in nature. In line with this, suggestions include \nfurther flexibilising working hours and locations, and \ninvesting in office infrastructures that provide space for \ncollaboration on the ground.\nTogether we take care –\nThe coronavirus pandemic impacted the economy and society \nthroughout the world in 2020. The lockdowns meant that reactions \nhad to be swift and flexible throughout the world. The pandemic \nshowed us all the more how valuable and full of life our Talanx \n \nPurpose Œ ‚Together we take care of the unexpected and foster entre\n-preneurship™ Œ is for the Group. As a sustainable company, Talanx was \nable to build on this and on its agile cooperation methods. \nTalanx reacted extremely flexibly and individually to its customers™ \nneeds. During the first lockdown, its employees advised customers \nremotely from home instead of from the office and resolved their in\n-surance claims, among other things. For example, HDI Deutschland \nAG stated early on that its business shutdown insurance customers \nwere covered by officially ordered closures due to the coronavirus. \nHDI Lebensversicherung AG is helping unbureaucratically in emer\n-gencies by allowing customers in Germany to defer premium \n \npayments without incurring interest penalties. This reflects the heart \nof our Purpose: ﬁCrises are mastered more easily together than on \none™s ownﬂ.\nThe culture of being there for each other begins within the Company \nitself. This high level of commitment in difficult times works so well \nbecause Talanx™s employees are there for each other, too, and because \nthe conditions that made it possible were created. Even though dis\n-tancing is currently required, colleagues within the Group are com\n-ing together even more closely at a metaphorical level. In Germany, \nfor example, a large number of employees voluntarily donated their \novertime to fellow workers who were facing particular challenges in \ncombining looking after children and working.\n  \nWolfgang Hanssmann, \nMember of the Board of \n \nManagement of HDI Deutschland AG\nWe are there for our \nclients at all times, \n even during the corona\n-virus pandemic, and \nreact highly flexibly \n and individually to \n their needs. \n\n15Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nMeasures \ntaken by\nTalanx \nworldwide\nMore information about \n the various activities is \n \navailable on the Internet.\nFRANCE: INSURANCE COVER \n FOR CLINICAL STUDIES \n \nRELATING TO COVID-˜˚\nHDI Global France o˛ers insurance solutions for clini\n-cal research to develop e˛ective means of combating \nthe coronavirus. Preconditions for insurance cover are \nthat the studies are conducted transparently and the \nrelevant rules are complied with.\nCompliance and Transparency\nOur business success depends, among other things, on our staff \n \nbehaving in a legally correct and transparent manner towards each \nother, our clients, business partners and shareholders, and the \n general public.\nThe coronavirus pandemic created new challenges for the compli\n-ance community within Talanx, since communication and training \nhad to continue in order to promote our compliance culture. This is \nwhy Talanx held its face\n-to\n-face training sessions as webinars in 2020. \nIn addition, the pandemic also led to greater monitoring of compli\n-ance rules during the reporting period. For example, the training \n \noffering at HDI Global (USA) was expanded to include cyber security \ntraining.\nThe Talanx Group supported its \ncustomers and sta˚ worldwide \nduring the di˛cult coronavirus \nperiod. This allowed us to react \nto the new situation both with \ndonations and by living up to our \nPurpose, ﬁTogether we take care of \nthe unexpected and foster entre\n-preneurshipﬂ.\n\n16Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nInvestment and \n Insurance Products\nInsurers fulfil an important social function: they enable the economy \nto function and provide financial security for individuals. Insurance \ncan both protect the standard of living of society as a whole and give \ncompanies the flexibility they need to deal with challenges. The \ncorona\n \nvirus pandemic demonstrated this impressively and Talanx \nacted in line with its Purpose. The Company adapted to the new situ\n-ation immediately and expanded its insurance cover to include the \neffects of the coronavirus. For example, it provided all doctors in \n \nGermany who volunteered to perform vaccinations with full profes\n-sional liability insurance, even if they had not previously been \n \ninsured with the Company or had already retired.\nRUSSIA: DEFERRAL OF \nPREMIUM PAYMENTS\nCiV Life o˛ers customers the option to \nsuspend premiums payments for up to \n60 days if they fall into arrears during the \ncoronavirus period or are having payment \ndi˝culties.\nCANADA, JAPAN, SINGAPORE: \nRISK CONSULTING FOR \n CORPORATE CUSTOMERS\nHDI Global o˛ers its customers risk consulting \nservices, including the management of emergency/\ncrisis plans and potential business closures.

This also allowed them to raise \nmoney for charitable causes. \nWork and Employees\nThe coronavirus pandemic radically changed the way that we at the \nTalanx Group operate within a very short space of time. Day\n-to\n-day \nwork at Talanx™s locations in 150 countries has changed and hybrid \nwork Œ which currently largely means working remotely and only \ncoming into the office when necessary Œ has become the new normal. \nA seamless IT infrastructure is critically important here. During the \ncoronavirus pandemic in 2020, well over 20,000 of the Talanx \nGroup™s roughly 23,000 employees were working remotely at times. \nComing in to the office was voluntary in 2020 and office capacity was \ncapped at roughly 25%. Protecting staff from infection continues to \nbe our top priority in 2021, while also ensuring that we remain opera\n-tional for our customers and sales partners.\nGERMANY: \n OVERTIME DONATED\nHDI Group employees in Germany are \ndonating overtime credits to colleagues \nwho are working at home and have to \nlook after their children at the same \ntime.

The new way of working led to fewer internal procedures \nand hence to fewer resources being used and less business travel. \nNevertheless, we had to keep operations running and adapt them to \nmeet new requirements. Among other things, additional laptops \nwere purchased for remote working.\nThe coronavirus pandemic also strongly impacted working life with\n-in the Group. Far fewer to no business trips were made in the report\n-ing period, and employees mainly worked remotely or used hybrid \nforms that combined office and remote work. This had a significant \nimpact on our carbon footprint for financial year 2020.\nCANADA: \n SUPPORT FOR THE \n VENTILATORS FOR \n CANADIANS INITIATIVE\nHDI Global Canada is supporting a \n \nconsortium of companies that is focusing \non manufacturing urgently needed \n ventilators for hospitals throughout \n the country.\nGERMANY: \n MOBILE DEVICES \n DONATED\nAt the HDI Group in Germany, retired business \niPhones and iPads are being donated to old peoples™ \nhomes and care facilities, so that residents can keep \nin contact with their loved ones while visits are pro\n-hibited.

By \n \nincluding environmental and social topics in our corporate manage\n-ment and corporate governance, we can help to promote sustainable \nactivities and hence to ensure the Company™s future success. As an \ninternational insurance group and a long\n-term investor, we are com\n-mitted to responsible corporate governance designed to achieve sus\n-tainable value creation. This report describes how we take environ\n-mental, social and governance aspects into account in our business.\nAs a global insurer, we also contribute actively to achieving global \nsustainability goals: the United Nations™ Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs), which came into force in 2016, comprise 17 concrete tar\n-gets designed to make the world a more sustainable and fairer place \nin the period up to 2030. In 2019, the Talanx Group identified seven \ngoals to which it can make concrete contributions (SDG˜4: Quality \nEducation, SDG˜5: Gender Equality, SDG˜7: Affordable and Clean \n \nEnergy, SDG˜8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG˜9: Industry, \nInnovation and Infrastructure, SDG˜12: Responsible Consumption \nand Production and SDG˜13: Climate Action).\nSustainability strategy and governance\n 102-40 | 102-42 | 102-44\n We derive our sustainability strategy from \nthe Talanx Group™s overarching strategy and align it with the Group™s \nmission statement and values. This integration with the Group™s \nstrategy supplements the latter to include ESG (environment, social \nand governance) aspects. The sustainability strategy comprises con\n-crete action areas, goals and measures, and serves to ensure that the \nCompany™s operations are aligned with environmental and social \nchallenges.\nThe following figure, ﬁOur Sustainability Approach Supports the \nTalanx Group™s Strategyﬂ, shows how our sustainability strategy \ndovetails with the Group™s strategy. It also shows that Œ in addition to \nthe social framework within which the Talanx Group operates Œ our \nsustainability strategy focuses on our core activities of asset \n \nmanagement, underwriting and operations.

After the Group signed \nup to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2019, it took \nthe next logical step for the Underwriting unit during the reporting \nperiod by undertaking to comply with the Principles for Sustainable \nInsurance (PSI). Another stated goal is to successively expand the \ncarbon neutrality achieved in 2019 for Talanx™s domestic operations \nto its international business. In addition, the Group is examining the \nrecommendations of the Task Force on Climate\n-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) in greater detail in the current financial year and \nis supporting this global reporting initiative for climate\n-related \n \nfinancial risks and opportunities. Talanx AG has also joined the UN \nGlobal Compact (UNGC) Œ the world™s largest initiative for good \n corporate governance.\nThe Talanx Group™s sustainability strategy addresses not only on the \nCompany™s social framework but also and in particular its core busi\n-ness: asset management, underwriting and operations. The main \nway in which the Group can contribute to sustainable development \nis through its investments and insurance products. It is therefore \naiming to integrate sustainability aspects more closely with its asset \nmanagement activities (in line with the ESG criteria adopted by the \nTalanx Group such as its coal phase\n-out pledge; see also the section \non the material topics), its insurance products and services, and its \noperational processes. As regards social topics, the sustainability \nstrategy focuses on seven SDGs to which the Group can make an ac\n-tive contribution. Both positive and any negative impacts on contri\n-butions to the SDGs will be continuously evaluated as part of the \nenhancements made to the sustainability strategy. No impact \n \nassessment has been performed to date.\nIn addition, the Company™s sustainability strategy and sustainability \nmanagement activities are based on the needs and interests of its \ntarget groups. Customers, business partners, investors and employ\n-ees play a particularly important role here. For further information \non our stakeholder survey, our stakeholder dialogue and on how \nTalanx™s material sustainability topics are determined, see the sec\n-tion entitled\n  ﬁMateriality analysis\nﬂ.Action areas\nTalanx uses our four action areas to operationalise its sustainability \nstrategy:\nCompliance and Transparency\nThe Compliance and Transparency action area is an interdisciplinary \nfunction covering adherence to statutory, legal and regulatory re\n-quirements and to the Company™s own Code of Conduct throughout \nthe Group and across all action areas. Both the trust placed in the \nTalanx Group and its competitiveness depend on this foundation for \nlegally correct, responsible and ethical conduct. In addition to topics \nsuch as anti\n-money laundering and anti\n-corruption, this includes \ndata protection/cybersecurity and tax compliance, for example. The \nTalanx Group wishes to be transparent about these and other topics.\n  SRˆ20ˆŒ page 42\n Investment and Insurance Products\nWithin the Talanx Group, the main areas of our business activities in \nwhich sustainability needs to be taken into account are our invest\n-ments and insurance products. For this reason, our long\n-term goal is \nto take sustainability criteria into account in our investments, insur\n-ance products and services. Topics such as transparency, easy\n-to\n-un-derstand information and fair advice play an important role here. We \nunderscore the sustainability activities for our core business by elect\n-ing to apply or become part of recognised international frameworks, \ninitiatives and reporting standards.\n  SRˆ20ˆŒ page 55\nWork and Employees\nThe Work and Employees action area shows that we take our \n \nemployees™ interests into account and that we are an attractive em\n-ployer and vocational training provider. The Talanx Group actively \nencourages and supports employee training and development, and \npromotes diversity and equal opportunities. This can also be seen \nfrom the fact that diversity is a Board of Management responsibility, \nand that we appointed a diversity &amp; inclusion manager in March \n2021. Talanx also takes social responsibility by actively promoting \nthe common good and supporting selected charitable projects and \ninitiatives.\n  NRˆ20ˆŒ page 73\n Day-to-day Operations and Procurement\nThe goal of the Day\n-to\n-Day Operations and Procurement action area \nis to organise our daily business and purchasing activities in a sus\n-tainable manner. This includes, for example, using resources sparing\n-ly, sourcing environmentally friendly products, respecting employee \nand human rights (including along the supply chain), and reducing \nour direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We also \nwant to encourage Talanx employees to conserve resources and take \nsustainability into account in their day\n-to\n-day activities, e.g. during \nbusiness trips.\n  NRˆ20ˆŒ page 91\n\n22Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nSustainability goals\nThe Talanx Group sets itself goals in the areas of ﬁStrategy and \n \nGovernanceﬂ and ﬁDialogue and Reportingﬂ, and in the four action \nareas making up its sustainability strategy.

Information\nMateriality analysis\n 102-40 | 102-43 | 102-46\n In keeping with the GRI Standards and the \nGerman CSR Directive Implementing Act (CSR\n-RUG), our sustainabil\n-ity report is based on a materiality analysis. The Talanx Group\'s initial \nstakeholder survey, which was performed in 2014, was updated and \nexpanded in financial year 2018. The Company also took an active \npart in a sector\n-wide stakeholder survey in the reporting period, in \nthe form of a workshop. This allowed Talanx to verify its materiality \nmatrix in discussions with its stakeholders. In addition, the annual \nmeeting of the Sustainability Competence Team examined how up to \ndate the current material topics are. A decision was reached that no \nchanges are required at present. A comprehensive, customised new \nstakeholder survey for the Talanx Group is being planned as part of \nthe regular schedule for 2022/2023, in line with the Group™s strategy \ncycle.\nThe analysis is based on our stakeholder surveys performed in 2014 \nand 2018: We identified the topics that are relevant for our sustaina\n-bility reporting using an internal survey of internal stakeholders and \nan online survey of external stakeholders, plus telephone interviews \nwith experts that were conducted in close cooperation with an exter\n-nal partner. We asked our internal stakeholders about three catego\n-ries: ﬁrelevance from our own perspectiveﬂ, ﬁimpact on business \n \nactivitiesﬂ and ﬁrelevance to businessﬂ. The external stakeholders \nevaluated the relevance of the topics from their own individual per\n-THE TALANX GROUP™S SUSTAINABILITY GOALS (NOT INCLUDING THE HANNOVER RE GROUP)\nGoalMeasure\nScope\nDeadlineStatus\nExpand and promote environmental protection in \nthe enterprise\nForm a ﬁsustainability communityﬂ at our Hannover location\nGermany, \nHannover\n2020DoneParticipate in the ﬁHannover ohne Plastikﬂ (HOP Œ \n ﬁHannover without Plasticﬂ) initiative.

We investigated a variety of potential material issues in \nthese surveys, ranking them for importance on a scale ranging from 1 \n(= not important) to 7 (= extremely important). We classified issues as \nﬁmaterialﬂ if they received an average score of 5.0 or more in the eval\n-uation. In addition, we held an internal workshop to prioritise the \nimpact of the Talanx Group™s operations on the non\n-financial \n \nmatters, and included this in the assessment. \nIn the course of its fundamental revision of its sustainability strategy \nin 2019, Talanx AG™s Board of Management defined climate change as \nan additional material aspect. Previously, climate change statements \nhad been included in the ﬁESG in asset managementﬂ and ﬁESG in \ninsurance solutionsﬂ aspects. The Group has identified a total of nine \nmaterial issues within the meaning of the HGB and also reports on \nthree others voluntarily as described below.\nAccording to the materiality analysis performed, the material topics \ncorrespond both to the GRI™s definition of materiality and to the \n \ncriterion of ﬁdouble materialityﬂ set out in the CSR\n-RUG. Material \ntopics are used both as input for producing the sustainability report \nand as a key component in enhancing our sustainability strategy and \nour sustainability goals.\nIdentifying sustainability topics\nAs set out in the GRI Standards, the first step in defining the report \ncontent was to draw up a comprehensive list of sustainability topics \nfor potential inclusion in Talanx™s sustainability strategy and sustain\n-ability report. This list was compiled using a broad range of sources, \nincluding\n Initiatives such as the UN Global Compact with its Ten Principles \non human rights, labour, the environment and anti\n-corruption, \n Information requirements for environmental, social and \n \ngovernance (ESG) ratings, \n The GRI Standards and the German Sustainability Code \n(Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitskodex Œ DNK), \n Specialist literature, the latest research results and studies. \nThe different topics were assessed by the Group\n-wide Sustainability \nCompetence Team to establish their significance for the activities, \nproducts and services performed or provided by the divisions, Corpo\n-rate Operations and the locations. Topics identified as relevant were \ntaken into account when developing the internal and external \n \nquestionnaires that Talanx used for the stakeholder survey.\n\nTHE TALANX GROUP™S STAKEHOLDERS\nCUSTOMERS\nEMPLOYEES\nINVESTORS\n AND ANALYSTS\nBUSINESS PARTNERS\nEmployment\n relationships\nTransparency\nFairness\nGood  governance\nASSOCIATIONS\nMEDIA\nNGO\nsResearch\nACADEMIA\nCompliance with the law\nPOLITICS\nDialogue\nCooperation\nReporting\n28Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nStakeholder survey and prioritisation of topics\n 102-42 | 102-43 | 102-44\n The main way in which we include our inter\n-est groups™ opinions is via our regular stakeholder surveys, which we \nuse to identify material topics for our sustainability strategy and sus\n-tainability report. The surveys identify the material topics for our \nsustainability strategy and the sustainability report. In addition, we \nregularly exchange information with non\n-governmental organisa\n-tions. Additionally, we take part in a number of ESG rating processes \nthat are specifically tailored to sustainability\n-conscious investors and \nanalysts. In the reporting period, these included the CDP (formerly \nthe Carbon Disclosure Project), MSCI and Sustainalytics ratings. \n \nDetailed information on our ratings and the results can be found on \nthe  Talanx\n website\n.They are based on our 2014 and 2018 stakeholder surveys: Talanx de\n-fined the stakeholder groups to be surveyed in advance and reflected \nthe wide range of stakeholder views by ensuring a balanced mix of \nopinions. Foreign stakeholder groups were also involved in order to \ntake the Group™s international reach into account. The written and \ntelephone surveys were conducted in the autumn of 2018. The follow\n-ing figure gives a breakdown of the 78 survey participants:\nSTAKEHOLDER SURVEY PARTICIPANTS\n%In addition to polling internal and external stakeholders, we held an \ninternal Group workshop on the materiality analysis together with \nthe Talanx Group™s Sustainability Competence Team. The latter com\n-prises representatives from a wide range of departments and divi\n-sions who are directly affected by the topic of sustainability. The \nworkshop was used to present and validate the results of the written \nand telephone surveys.

The topic owners are the full Board of Man\n-agement of Talanx AG. As is the case with the Group™s other goals, \nvalues and strategies, the full Board of Management resolves and \nmonitors the development and enhancement of Talanx™s sustainabil\n-ity strategy, its sustainability goals and the implementation of the \nassociated measures. The Board has underscored the importance of \nsustainability to the Group through its\n  Sustainability Commit\n-ment\n, which was issued by the full Board of Management and has \nbeen published as voluntarily additional information on our website. \nAt an organisational level, Group Communications is responsible for \nsustainability, and frames and coordinates sustainability manage\n-ment activities for the Talanx Group. This includes developing sus\n-tainability goals and preparing the sustainability report. The head of \nGroup Communications reports directly to the Chairman of the \nBoard of Management, who is responsible for sustainability/ESG. At \nthe level of the Supervisory Board, the Finance and Audit Committee \nregularly addresses the topic of sustainability/ESG and receives the \nannual report on the consolidated non\n-financial statement in \nTalanx™s Group annual report.\n 102-29 | 102-31 | 102-32 \nThe Board of Management addresses environ\n-mental and social impacts, risks and opportunities several times a \nyear. It does this firstly as part of risk management, and secondly \nduring the development, enhancement and implementation of the \nsustainability strategy. This process includes preparing the sustaina\n-bility report and defining and monitoring sustainability goals, \namong other things.Due to the Group™s decentralised organisational structure, most \n \nsustainability measures are implemented by the individual divisions \nand Corporate Operations as part of their respective core businesses. \nThe goals and measures are agreed, and data for reporting are cap\n-tured, by a competence team comprising representatives from all di\n-visions, the relevant companies, Corporate Operations and Talanx AG \ndepartments. We are in dialogue via a number of working groups \nwith the Hannover Re Group, our subsidiary, which has drawn up its \nown sustainability strategy and publishes a separate sustainability \nreport.\nIn financial year 2017, we set up the Responsible Investment Commit\n-tee (RIC), a new sustainability body designed to implement our ESG \nscreening process aimed at increasing the sustainability of invest\n-ments (see also the section entitled ﬁESG in asset managementﬂ on\n  page 63 ff.). In financial year 2019, Talanx™s Board of Management decided, in the \ninterests of increasing internal transparency about ESG aspects in \nunderwriting, to add a fixed item Œ the ﬁResponsible Underwriting \nCommitteeﬂ (RUC) Œ to the agenda for the first and another Board of \nManagement meeting every year. This body is also looking more \nclosely at ESG aspects in underwriting. A working group supports the \nRUC at an operational level. \n 102-12\n The Talanx Group is involved in a number of sustainability, \ncorporate social responsibility (CSR) and good governance initiatives. \nIn addition to the German Corporate Governance Code and Poland™s \nﬁBest Practice of GPW Listed Companiesﬂ code, which governs com\n-panies that are listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, these include (in \nthe case of the Retail Germany Division) the Code of Conduct drawn \nup by the German Insurance Association (GDV). Talanx is also a \nmember of the Hannover Climate Alliance 2020, has signed up to the \nDiversity Charter and has joined the Global Insurance Chief Compli\n-ance Officers (CCO) Forum. Additionally, Talanx became a member of \nthe Fair Company Initiative in 2016 and joined the ﬁHannover ohne \nPlastikﬂ (HOP Œ ﬁHannover without Plasticﬂ) initiative in 2019. Also in \n2019, Talanx signed up for the Principles for Responsible Investment, \nwhile in the reporting period the Group committed itself to observ\n-ing the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), which relate to its \ncore insurance business. Moreover, since 2020 Talanx has supported \nthe recommendations of the Task Force on Climate\n-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) and also signed up to the UN Global Compact \n(UNGC) in the reporting period, rounding off its commitment to sus\n-tainability initiatives. \nStakeholder inclusiveness \n 102-29 | 102-43\n The Talanx Group liaises with its stakeholders in \nmany areas, with a key focus being on determining impacts, opportu\n-nities and risks. For example, Human Resources is in contact with the \nco-determination bodies, Investor Relations has close relationships \nwith shareholders and bondholders, and Group Communications \n \naddresses both the general public and employees. In addition, the \nGroup and the companies belonging to it are, for example, members \nof regional and national associations and interest groups, and are \ntherefore up to speed with current developments (see also the section \nentitled ﬁThe Talanx Group Œ key membershipsﬂ on\n  page 110 ff.). \nOur performance metrics address dimensions above and beyond \nthe purely financial perspective Œ specifically, these are market and \ncustomer viewpoints, the internal process perspective and the \n \nemployee viewpoint. As a result, the various stakeholder group \n \nmatters are also taken into account during management of the \nGroup (see also the ﬁPerformance managementﬂ section of the\n  2020 Group Annual Report\n).\n33Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nSUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE\nThis overview is designed to show that the Talanx Group™s Super-\nvisory Board and Board of Management regularly address the topic of \nsustainability/ESG and determine the topic area™s direction.

The \naverage temperature on Earth is rising as emissions of greenhouse \ngases increase. Scientific studies prove that this is producing more \nextreme weather events, leading to significantly higher losses from \nnatural disasters and to the expectation for us, as insurers, of a grow\n-ing need for insurance solutions to protect against natural catastro\n-phes (natcat risks). This affects both our Primary Insurance and our \nReinsurance operations. \nEfficient environmental protection is therefore crucially important \nto our business strategy. We are committed to supporting the Paris \nAgreement and to transitioning to a low\n-carbon economy. We aim to \ncontribute to this using three elements Œ asset management, under\n-writing and environmental management Œ and to steadily expand \nour contribution going forward. \nThe Task Force on Climate\n-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), \nwhich the Talanx Group has supported since the spring of 2020, \npublished dedicated recommendations for transparent, effective \ncorporate climate reporting in 2017. For example, the TCFD calls on \ncompanies to transparently disclose their strategy for dealing with \nthe opportunities and risks associated with climate change to their \nshareholders and other stakeholders. \nThe TCFD breaks down its recommendations into four thematic areas \nthat represent core elements of how organisations operate (see the \nfigure below).\nWe are committed to transparent \nclimate reporting so as to ensure \ngood corporate governance focused \non sustainable value creation.\nTCFD \n Reporting\n\nCORE ELEMENTS OF THE TCFD\nGOVERNANCE\nDisclose the organization™s governance around \n \nclimate-related risks and opportunities. \nSTRATEGY\nDisclose the strategy for managing the impacts \n of actual and potential climate-related risks and \nopportunities.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nDisclose how the organisation identi˜es, assesses \n and manages climate-related risks.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and \nmanage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.\nGOVERNANCE\nSTRATEGY\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nMETRICS \n AND \n TARGETS\n38Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nThis 2020 Sustainability Report is also our first TCFD Report. It serves \nas the baseline and starting point for our reporting of climate\n-related \nrisks. We consider the continuous expansion of our TCFD reporting \non climate\n-related opportunities and risks in the coming years to be \nan important development process for the Talanx Group that we \nshall implement step by step. We shall inform our stakeholders \n \ntransparently of key milestones and the progress we make, e.g. in \n \nimplementing our climate scenario analysis. \nGovernance\nTalanx AG™s Board of Management has underscored the importance \nof sustainability to the Group in its\n  Sustainability Commitment \nas follows: ﬁThe Talanx Group is integrating environmental, social \nand governance aspects with its business activities. As an interna\n-tional insurance group and a long\n-term investor, we are committed \nto responsible corporate governance based on sustainable value cre\n-ation. Equally, our customers generally enter into long\n-term relation\n-ships with us. We therefore take a forward\n-looking approach so as to \nensure that we can deliver on the promises we make to our custom\n-ers in the future, too.ﬂ This explicit inclusion of long\n-term develop\n-ments clearly shows that climate change is highly relevant to Talanx™s \ncore business. \nTalanx™s sustainability management is designed at the enterprise \n \nlevel and is being rolled out successively across its core markets. The \ntopic owners are the full Board of Management of Talanx AG. \n Climate \nchange is a material topic in our sustainability management (see the \nmateriality matrix on\n  page 29 and the Board of Management is \ndirectly responsible for this (see the sustainability governance \ngraphic). The full Board of Management oversees and resolve \n \nenhancements to the sustainability strategy, the sustainability goals \nand the implementation of measures. \nAt an organisational level, Group Communications is responsible for \nsustainability, and organises and coordinates sustainability manage\n-ment activities for the Talanx Group. This includes developing sus\n-tainability goals, maintaining the ESG data repository and preparing \nthe sustainability report, among other things. The head of Group \nCommunications reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of \nManagement.\nThe Board of Management examines the current implementation sta\n-tus of the sustainability strategy and the strategic action areas at least \ntwice a year, and generally several times a year. The agenda \n covers not \nonly ESG\n-related opportunities and risks but also the environmental \nand social impacts of Talanx™s business activities. Climate\n- change \n \naspects are addressed firstly as part of risk management and secondly \nduring strategic enhancements to the sustainability strategy.\n\n39Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nTopics addressed by Talanx™s Board of Management in the past finan\n-cial year included the following:\n Sustainability Strategy\n ESG risks \n Group underwriting policy for dealing with \n coal risks and oil sands \n Climate strategy for investments\nExternal presenters and experts also provided input on the sustaina\n-bility strategy and climate change as part of a Board of Management \nmeeting. \nStrategy\nThe Talanx Group™s sustainability strategy is derived from the Group \nstrategy and aligned with the Group™s mission statement and values. \nThis integration with the Group™s strategy supplements the latter to \ninclude ESG (environment, social and governance) aspects. The sus\n-tainability strategy comprises concrete action areas, goals and meas\n-ures, and serves to ensure that the Company™s operations are aligned \nwith environmental and social challenges. \nIn addition to the social framework of which the Talanx Group is a \npart, our sustainability strategy focuses primarily on our three core \nareas: asset management, underwriting and operations (see also the \nfigure illustrating our sustainability strategy on \n page 20). A long\n-term approach and sustainability are also cornerstones of our \nnew remuneration system for the Board of Management: we explicitly \ninclude non\n-financial performance targets designed to promote the \nCompany™s sustainable development in our measurement of variable \nremuneration, in the form of the ﬁleadership/commitment (OHC)ﬂ and \nﬁcontribution to our sustainability strategyﬂ criteria.\nIn its operations, the Talanx Group is working towards its goal of mak\n-ing its business carbon\n-neutral throughout the world by 2030 and of \ncontinuing to substantially reduce the carbon emissions produced as \npart of its own operating procedures. The first step towards achieving \nthis goal has been for the Group to offset the carbon emissions gener\n-ated by its operations in Germany; as a result, its German business has \nbeen completely carbon\n-neutral since 2019. Talanx adopts the princi\n-ple here of avoiding, reducing and offsetting emissions. A key element \nis also to consistently procure certified green electricity. \nIn its underwriting, the Group is continuously enhancing its under\n-writing policy and increasingly focusing on ESG aspects in the process. \nFor example, in 2019 Talanx resolved to withdraw completely from \ncoal-based business models by 2038. The Responsible Underwriting \nCommittee Œ the newly formed ESG body at Board of Management lev\n-el Œ ensures transparency about the Group\n-wide underwriting policy \nand discusses its ongoing development.\nIn the asset management area, the Responsible Investment Commit\n-tee helps operationalise our sustainability strategy. Talanx no longer \ninvests in companies that derive more than 25% of their revenue or \ngenerate more than 25% of their power from coal. Above and beyond \nthis, we are limiting the duration of our investments to 2038. This is in \nline with the Group™s sustainability strategy, in which we have set our\n-selves the goal of exiting coal entirely by that year. We also extended \nour list of screening criteria in 2019 to include oil sands. The new screen \nexcludes companies that generate more than 25% of revenues from \nthis source. In addition, we check whether issuers meet our ESG criteria \nbefore making new securities purchases.\nApart from successively raising the bar for our ESG approach in \n \nasset management, we are enhancing the transparency of our in\n-vestment portfolio by signing up to the Principles for Responsible \nInvestment (PRI). In a further move, we are stepping up investments \nin climate\n-friendly infrastructure projects that promote economic \ndevelopment. In April 2020, we also set up an overarching working \ngroup to develop a climate strategy for investments with the aim of \nhelping achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change \n(  page 65).In terms of its social commitment, the Group focuses on seven of the \n17 SDGs. Talanx takes appropriate measures to support these in the \nshort, medium and long term. This is one way in which we want as a \ncompany to help make the world a more sustainable, fairer place by \n2030. For concrete examples, please see \n page 34.When revising our sustainability strategy in 2019, Talanx AG™s Board \nof Management defined climate change as an additional material as\n-pect. For us as a global insurance group, climate change is a material \nsustainability aspect that has a significant impact on all our business \nactivities. \nWe see opportunity and risk management as one of our major \nstrengths. Monitoring and managing our risk positions are part of \nthe Talanx Group™s core business. Our objective is to avoid develop\n-ments that pose existential risks while at the same time taking \n \nadvantage of opportunities that arise.\nThis is the backdrop to the work by an interdisciplinary project group \nin the current financial year on a comprehensive climate scenario \nanalysis. We shall inform readers about the results in future TCFD \n reports.\nTalanx monitors emerging risks such as climate change and envi\n-ronmental and social aspects whose risk content cannot yet be relia\n-bly assessed as part of its Group\n-wide risk management process. The \nTalanx Group captures and assesses these risks in a group\n-wide \n \nprocess that integrates experts from a number of different units. In \naddition, the Company makes use of external expertise and material \nfor this.\nDetails of how we identify , quantify and manage risks and determine \nrisk capital requirements are provided on \n page 61 onwards.\n\n40Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nRisk management\nWe consider climate risks as being part of an overarching framework \nfor qualitative and quantitative risk reporting and management. \nMonthly risk updates are used to report climate aspects, among other \nthings, to the Group™s Board of Management. \nOne key tool here is the internal risk capital model, which is used \namong other things to assess natural disaster events both at Group \nlevel and at the level of the individual subsidiaries. \nAnother tool is the annual emerging risks survey, which aims to iden\n-tify significant future risks for Talanx. This looks at new risk types for \nthe Company that can result from technological developments, envi\n-ronmental risks and social, geopolitical and economic changes. \n \nClimate\n-related factors are included in this emerging risk survey for \nthe entire Group. \nThe Talanx Group uses a Group\n-wide risk management framework \nthat is also used to assess natural disasters. Each unit is responsible \nfor monitoring its exposure to individual natural disaster risks and \nfor the structure of its local reinsurance, based on its local risk appe\n-tite and capitalisation. At Group level, the full Board of Management \nreviews and approves the risk tolerance level. Each year, the divisions \nreport their limit and threshold system risk budgets for natural disas\n-ters in the following year to the Talanx Group. Where the assumption \nis that climate change risks will only increase slowly from year to \nyear, this annual increase is reflected in the reported risk budget for \nthe following year.\nThe insurance cover for the approved risk tolerance level is then pur\n-chased each year by Talanx AG or by its subsidiary directly. In future, \na large proportion of non\n-facultative reinsurance will be pooled at \nTalanx AG in its role as internal Group reinsurer. This cover aims to \nprotect the Group against excessive losses from natural disasters. The \nTalanx Group uses special techniques for modelling natural disasters. \nCatastrophes combining portfolio data (geographical location, and \nthe features and values of the property insured) are calculated using \nsimulated natural disaster scenarios to assess the extent and \n \nfrequency of potential losses. Where such stochastic models do not \nexist, we use deterministic, scenario\n-based approaches to estimate \npotential losses.\nFurther details about our risk management process can be found in \nthe risk report on\n  page 108\n Œ 124 of the Group Annual Report 2020.\nOur overarching qualitative and quantitative risk reporting address\n-es climate change and also promotes discussion of climate risks and \nopportunities within Risk Management. Our ESG approach uses our \nResponsible Underwriting Committee and Responsible Investment \nCommittee to integrate climate and sustainability considerations \nwith our underwriting and asset management decisions. Another \nkey element in this process is the climate scenario analysis men\n-tioned earlier.\nMetrics and targets\nTalanx™s Board of Management formulated the overarching strategic \ngoal of operating carbon\n-neutrally at its German locations from finan\n-cial year 2019 onwards. After determining its corporate carbon foot\n-print in Germany for the first time in 2019, the Group again offset \nunavoidable carbon emissions in 2020 using two high\n-quality offset \nprojects in Indonesia and Brazil (reforestation: REDD+; Verified Car\n-bon Standard (VCS) &amp; Climate, Community and Biodiversity (CCBS) \nproject). Talanx™s approach is firstly to avoid and secondly to reduce \ngreenhouse gases, and only in a third step to offset them. \nWe worked together with an external partner to determine the carbon \nfootprint for our German locations and hence measure our carbon \nemissions. Scope 1, 2 and in some cases also Scope 3 emissions were \nincluded in this process. Talanx is successively expanding its climate \nfootprinting activities throughout the Group: this applies both to the \nScope limits and to the locations covered. The goal is to have complet\n-ed this expansion in 2030 and for the entire Talanx Group to be oper\n-ating climate\n-neutrally by then. This applies both to the successive \naugmentation of the carbon footprint (Scopes 1Œ3) and to the cover\n-age/inclusion of Talanx™s major companies abroad.\nEmissions are mainly calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. \nThe emission factors used are from reliable sources. The emissions \ncaused by the Company are calculated on the basis of the activities \nperformed in corporate processes. The relevant metrics, measures \nand results are published in the sustainability report and are also doc\n-umented in a separate emissions report. The more exactly these are \ncaptured, the more precisely the emissions calculated correspond to \nthe Company™s actual emissions. The data can essentially be broken \ndown into primary and secondary data. Primary data are captured \n \ndirectly by the reporting entity or service providers that are directly \ninvolved in the process. By contrast, secondary data are sourced from \nstudies, databases or other external sources and often only represent \naverage values. Therefore, as a matter of principle, calculations that \nare based on primary data can reflect corporate emissions more \n realistically.\nThe data used for the carbon footprint can also be broken down into \ntwo types: firstly activity data, i.e. company\n-specific data on e.g. vehi\n-cle fleets, electricity consumption or purchased goods. The second \ntype are emission factors that are used to calculate the emissions by \nmultiplying them with the prepared activity data.\nWe work continuously to enhance the quality of the data used to cal\n-culate emissions. Within Germany, a large volume of very high quality \nprimary data are already available for carbon footprinting Œ e.g. in the \ncategories of energy consumption, the vehicle fleet, waste generation \nand business trips. However, there is room for improvement when \n \ndetermining employees™ journeys to and from work and our paper \nconsumption. Going forward, the effects of more mobile working will \nalso have to be taken into account. \n\n41Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nTCFD Reporting\nAction Areas\nFurther Information\nIn keeping with the requirements set out in the Greenhouse Gas \n \nProtocol, the Talanx Group™s domestic carbon footprint includes all \n \ndomestic activities that give rise to greenhouse gas emissions allocable \nto Scope 1 and Scope 2. In addition, Scope 3 is used to capture other \n \nactivities that are considered relevant (operating systems boundaries): \nScope 1\n Fuel consumed in heating systems \n Fuel consumed by the vehicle fleet \nScope 2\n Purchased electricity \n Purchased district heating \nScope 3\n Purchased goods and services (drinking water and paper) \n Upstream fuel purchases \n Waste produced \n Employee travel to and from work \n Business trips \nScope 3 category no. 15 Œ emissions caused by investments Œ is \n \nparticularly relevant for the Talanx Group as a financial services \n provider.\nThis is why an overarching working group was set up in April 2020 to \ndevelop a climate strategy for investments, with the aim of helping to \nachieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The \nstrategy is currently focused on decarbonising the internally man\n-aged bond and equities portfolios, i.e. on reducing these investments™ \ncarbon footprint (Scope 1+2). Our goal is to reduce this figure by 30% \ncompared to the beginning of 2020 by 2025; this corresponds to an \nannual reduction in carbon intensity of roughly 7%. This current tar\n-get is an important step towards developing a sustainable, long\n-term \npath towards carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, the Group is ex\n-amining how a climate strategy can be extended to cover additional \nasset classes, and how climate\n-friendly investments and engagement \nactivities can be included in the strategy (\n  page 65). In the long term, the Talanx Group aims to increase the inclusion of \nsustainability criteria in insurance products and services. This is why \nit defined an underwriting policy for coal risks in the spring of 2019. \nIt is withdrawing in the long term from insuring coal risks and is no \nlonger underwriting risks for newly planned coal\n-fired power stations \nand coal mines. In those countries in which coal plays a particularly \nlarge role in the energy mix and where access to alternative energy \nsources is insufficient, Talanx will permit a limited number of excep\n-tions for insurance cover in individual cases, after reviewing the tech\n-nical standards. Since coal can only be phased out responsibly in the \nmedium to long term, the aim is no longer to have any coal\n-fired \npower stations or coal mines in the portfolio by 2038. In 2020, the \nunderwriting policy for coal risks was extended to include oil sands.\n\n42Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\n1Compliance and Transparency\nPAGE\nManagement approach \n 47Compliance\n 48Human rights at Talanx\n 50Anti-corruption and anti-money laundering\n 51Data protection and cybersecurity\n 52 Digital transformation\n 54\n43Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nPromoting \ncompliance \nthrough \n information \nsharing\nOur ComplianceXchange meetings \nare an ideal way to maintain our \ncompliance culture.\nMembers of Talanx™s \n \nCompliance team from \naround the world taking \npart in their quarterly \nvirtual ComplianceX\n-change meeting.

Regular dialogue throughout the entire organisation helps \nGroup Compliance to establish where advice needs to be provided \nearly on, and to develop training courses on new compliance topics \nand risks. The training sessions, which were previously held face\n-to\n-face, took the form of interactive online seminars in 2020 because of \nthe coronavirus pandemic.\nA global network of compliance officers assists the Chief Compliance \nOfficer in his tasks. One of them is Patricia Ryan, Chief Legal Officer \nand Senior Vice President at HDI USA, whose job means she is a mem\n-ber of the Group™s compliance community.\nTalanx Group Compliance introduced the ComplianceXchange for\n-mat several years ago. The virtual compliance meetings take place \nevery quarter and aim to discuss compliance issues at a global level. \nGroup Compliance and the local compliance officers around the \nworld regularly use them to share information on best\n-practice solu\n-tions and local developments in individual countries. Issues dis\n-cussed last year included how to deal with sanctions und embargoes, \nGermany™s Money Laundering Act (GwG), fair competition and data \nprotection. This dialogue is flanked by information material on \n \nspecific compliance issues that is tailored to individual stakeholders™ \nneeds. For example, in 2020 the Talanx department responsible for \nsustainability presented new developments regarding the Group™s \nsustainability obligations.\nThe global ComplianceXchange format\n Enables ideas sharing on compliance issues\n Allows compliance experts to keep abreast of the \n latest developments\n Permits resource sharing among compliance experts\n Ensures uniform communication across the \n distributed \n community\nCompliance training\nThe pandemic created new challenges for our compliance communi\n-ty.

It is headed by the Chief \n \nCompliance Officer, who is also Talanx AG™s Corporate \nGovernance Officer and Chief Representative, and who \nreports directly to the Chairman of Talanx AG™s Board of \nManagement. The Compliance department is responsible \nfor formulating and enhancing compliance policies such as \nthe Group™s Compliance Guidelines and its compliance \nstructures, for following up on complaints and compliance \nbreaches, and for internal training within the Group. In \naddition, it provides comprehensive advisory services on \nrelevant compliance topics where required.\nTalanx™s Compliance team offers guidance to colleagues and trains \nthem on compliance topics. Our training plan, which is tailored to \nspecific target groups, gives Group employees regular opportunities \nto refresh, expand and deepen their knowledge of selected compli\n-ance topics. New employees receive detailed information at onboard\n-ing events. Web\n-based training (WBT) offerings are another important \ntraining tool, and were expanded during the reporting period. In addi\n-tion to the Group™s anti\n-corruption training courses, which ensure \nthat donations are handled correctly, Compliance offers special \n \ntarget-group\n-specific courses on topics such as financial sanctions \nand embargoes, integrity, the capital markets and antitrust law.\nThe coronavirus pandemic that dominated the reporting period led \nto increased legal monitoring efforts. Our multifaceted training pro\n-gramme had to be adapted, with planned classroom sessions being \noffered and held as interactive online webinars. In addition, HDI \nGlobal (USA) offered all employees modular compliance training. \nHDI Global recognised the current increased risk posed by a remote \nworkforce and focused on providing expanded cyber security train\n-ing. It also used the platform to deliver modular compliance training \ncourses on how to manage staff working outside the office, on diver\n-sity and inclusion, and on combating psychological harassment, \nfraud and unconscious bias. The aim was to strengthen the compli\n-ance culture across the distributed community.\n\n47Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nCompliance and \nTransparency \nManagement approach\n 102-16\n Our business success depends not only on the quality of \nour products and services, but also on our employees acting in a \n \nlegally correct and responsible manner in their interactions with \neach other and with our business partners, shareholders and the gen\n-eral public. Our employees™ behaviour is based on the principles of \nfair, polite dealings and on respect for individuals™ personal rights.\nModern corporate governance is part of Talanx™s DNA. In addition to \nconstantly keeping abreast of the changing legal framework, Talanx \nissues a declaration of conformity with the German Corporate \n \nGovernance Code every year, see the chapter entitled ﬁCorporate \n governanceﬂ (\n  page 10 ). An annual declaration on the corporate gov\n-ernance rules set out in the Best Practice of GPW Listed Companiesﬂ \ncode (Poland) is also issued. Equally, Talanx AG™s internal Corporate \nGovernance Principles are regularly revised.\nMore than 4,000 staff members helped develop the Talanx Purpose: \nﬁTogether we take care of the unexpected and foster entrepreneur\n-shipﬂ. This combines three key ideas: First, ﬁTogetherﬂ symbolises the \nreciprocal nature of the mutual insurance company that was the \n \norigin of the Talanx Group in 1903. It stands for our closeness to our \ncustomers and partners. And not least also for the cooperation \n \nbetween brands and divisions within the Group, and for how we work \ntogether as colleagues. In other words, this word refers to both parts \nof the motto. Second, ﬁwe take care of the unexpectedﬂ stands for the \nrecognition that we do not see the unknown as a threat, but rather as \na promise to our customers to be there when they really need us. And \nthird, ﬁfoster entrepreneurshipﬂ aims to strengthen an entrepreneur\n-ial approach to business, both at our clients and partners and within \nthe Talanx Group. Not only do we act this way ourselves; our work \nalso helps other businesspeople. This harks back all the way to when \nthe Group was founded in 1903 Œ by customers, in order to think like \nthem. We can achieve more together than we can alone. \nAn internal annual award is used to honour activities, projects and \nline department activities that serve as particularly good role models \nfor our corporate culture. The Talanx Values Award was conferred in \nthe years between 2016 and 2018. As from 2019, it has focused more \non agile, digital transformation. It was renamed the Agile Award, and \nfrom 2020 onwards it has been known as the Talanx Transformation \nWe comply with the law and \n regulations relating to the environ\n-ment and society.

A total of 89 projects from 22 countries were entered in the \nTalanx Transformation Award competition in 2020. An independent \njury selected a shortlist of the 10 best projects for the finals. All \n \nemployees throughout the Group were asked to vote for the winners. \nHDI Seguros Brazil took first place with its ﬁHDI One Clickﬂ project. \nOur Brazilian subsidiary™s motor vehicle insurance operations are \nfully digital \n- from quotes through policywriting down to loss adjust\n-ment Œ and are revolutionising the market.\nHow far these values have helped take the Group can be seen from \nthe  HDI Museum\n (Talanx | HDI Group opens company museum \nin Hannover) at HDI\n-Platz 1 in Hannover. The 140 square metre space \nuses a mix of exhibits, eye witness reports and installations to docu\n-ment the history of the insurance group, which stretches back more \nthan 110 years.\nThe key principles and rules for all Talanx Group employees are set \nout in the  Code of Conduct\n; see ﬁComplianceﬂ in the next section \nand the section entitled ﬁSustainability of insurance productsﬂ \n (  page 66 ff.), plus the  Code of Conduct for Insurance Distribu\n-tion drawn up by the German Insurance Association\n (GDV).\nCompliance\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n For the Talanx Group, it goes without saying \nthat complying with the law is an absolute prerequisite for sustained \nbusiness success. This means that compliance is an integral part of all \nGroup activities. In addition to the areas of its compliance manage\n-ment system that the Talanx Group has defined as core/coordination \ntopics, it also helps ensure that environmental and social laws and \nregulations are observed.\nTopic Boundary:\n Compliance is relevant at all levels of the Talanx \nGroup, from divisions through departments down to individual \n \nemployees. Outside the Group, it can affect customers, business \n \npartners and suppliers in particular.\nImpacts:\n Compliance in general means the observance of, or adher\n-ence to, laws and regulations, and its main objective is to avoid nega\n-tive impacts caused by these being breached. At the same time, how\n-ever, the Talanx Group aims to use the ﬁCompliance and Transparencyﬂ \naction area to provide information and make disclosures on the topics \nof compliance and corporate governance. This enhances transparency \nwithin the Group and improves comparability with competitors.\n 103-2 | 407-1 | 408-1 | 409-1 | 412-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n ﬁTogeth\n-er for Integrityﬂ, our Group\n-wide Code of Conduct, is an effective tool \nfor making our commitment to complying with existing laws and \nour voluntary undertakings transparent. It sets out key principles \nand rules applicable to employees at all levels of the Talanx Group. \nThe Code serves to explain to employees the fundamental legal and \nethical requirements that they have to abide by during their work for \nthe various Group companies, and to provide further details of their \nduties in this area. In addition, it expressly highlights the ban on \nmoney laundering and illegal financing and draws attention to the \nfact that the competent anti\n-money laundering officer and/or the \ncompliance officer must be informed of all suspected cases. The Code \nof Conduct applies throughout the Group and is available in a num\n-ber of languages. Customers, employees and other stakeholders can \naccess it publicly on our website. The\n  Code\n is supplemented by a \nset of more concrete Compliance Guidelines and by other informa\n-tion and explanatory documents, which are available on our intranet. \nThe Compliance Guidelines provide detailed minimum require\n-ments regarding the content of the principles set out in the Code of \nConduct, which have been discussed and adopted as binding by the \nGroup™s companies in Germany and abroad.\nTalanx™s\n  whistle\n-blowing system\n can be used to report certain sig\n-nificant breaches of the law. It can be accessed from anywhere in the \nworld via our website and is currently available in German and eight \nother languages commonly spoken within the Group. The whistle\n-blowing system can be used Œ fully anonymously, if desired Œ to pro\n-vide information about a variety of issues (including fraud, breaches \nof fiduciary duty and corruption; incorrect bookkeeping or account\n-ing; anti\n-competitive and anti\n-trust offences; money laundering and \nterrorist financing; breaches of capital market regulations, sanctions \nand embargoes; and infringements of supervisory law and tax law \nprovisions). Additionally, employees can report suspected breaches \nof the law or guidelines to their line manager or directly to the com\n-pliance officer responsible for the company in question within the \nTalanx Group or the division concerned.\nA training plan tailored to the needs of different groups offers em\n-ployees regular opportunities to refresh and expand their knowledge \nof and expertise in selected compliance topics. New employees are \nregularly familiarised with the compliance framework during induc\n-tion events. In addition, regular virtual or classroom\n-based courses \nand web\n-based training (WBT) are provided on relevant compliance \ntopics. Anti\n-corruption training ensures that gifts are dealt with cor\n-rectly and sensitise employees for situations in which conflicts of \n \ninterest may arise in their day\n-to\n-day work. Other specialists topics \nare offered to specific target groups, based on a risk analysis. Above \nand beyond this, seminars are held several times a year for executives \nand selected specialists in order to promote the Group™s compliance \nculture. This dialogue Œ which was held most recently under the \n \nmotto of ﬁHonesty\n-Decency\n-Integrityﬂ, supports Group Compliance \nand supplements the risk analysis performed by identifying any \n \nexisting needs early on, enabling suitable training and advisory offer\n-ings to be developed. A number of measures are taken to strengthen \ncooperation within the network of local compliance officers. The \n \nestablished ﬁComplianceXchangeﬂ format, in which Group Compli\n-ance and the local compliance officers share information virtually \nand develop best practice solutions, proved particularly valuable in \nan environment that was dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. \nAs a result, it was possible not only to continue holding the regular \nComplianceXchange meetings but also to grow the format into an \nactive joint forum, with representatives of other specialist functions \nsuch as Sustainability and Data Protection taking part for the first \ntime.\n49Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nResponsibilities:\n Compliance is a Group\n-level function that takes the \nform of an independent department. It is headed by the Chief \n \nCompliance Officer, who is also the Corporate Governance Officer \nand who reports directly to the Chairman of Talanx AG™s Board of \nManagement. The compliance officers responsible for the individual \ndivisions and Group companies report to the Group Chief Compli\n-ance Officer. The Compliance department is responsible for estab\n-lishing and enhancing Group guidelines and structures designed to \nensure compliance, for following up on complaints and compliance \nbreaches, and for internal training within the Group. In addition, it \nprovides in\n-depth advice on relevant compliance issues on an ad hoc \nbasis where necessary.\nA global network of compliance managers at our foreign locations \nassists the Chief Compliance Officer in his tasks. This means that local \ncompliance breaches can also be reported directly to Group Compli\n-ance in Hannover. The Chief Compliance Officer prepares an annual \nreport on material compliance issues and developments for the \nBoard of Management.\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring: \nAdherence to compliance \nrequirements is monitored by Group Compliance, and by Group \n \nAuditing during regular internal audits. Continuous content reviews \nof the applicable compliance rules and regulations are performed, \nand revisions are made where necessary. In addition, the Group takes \nstakeholders™ interests and requirements relating to compliance and \ntransparency into account, firstly by engaging in a dialogue with \nthem about sustainability and secondly by adhering to the GRI \nStandards and taking part in ESG rating processes.\n 206-1 | 419-1\n Talanx is not aware of any significant fines or \nnon-monetary sanctions that were levied for non\n-compliance with \nlaws and regulations in financial year 2020. Likewise, there are no \nknown significant cases of anti\n-competitive behaviour, or of \n \nanti\n-trust or monopoly practices. See the section entitled ﬁEasy\n-to\n- understand information about insurance solutionsﬂ (\n  page67 ff\n.) for information on cases in connection with products. \n 307-1\n Talanx is not aware of any fines or sanctions levied for \nnon-compliance with environmental protection laws or regulations.\n 419-1\n There were no known grievances about impacts on society \nin the Retail Germany or Industrial Lines divisions in Germany in \n2020. The same also applies to the foreign companies (Retail Interna\n-tional Division) covered by this report. \nTax compliance and transparency\n 207-1\n The Group™s tax policy is set out in writing in the Group Tax \nand Tax Compliance Guidelines; it falls within the CFO™s area of \n \nresponsibility and is resolved by the full Board of Management. The \ncontent of these internal Group guidelines is reviewed annually in \nfull. The tax policy is derived from Talanx AG™s strategy and as a \n \nmatter of principle applies only to Germany (not including the \n \nHannover Re Group and HDI Global Specialty), including foreign \nbranches of domestic Group companies. The top priorities are mini\n-mising tax risks and tax compliance. The tax policy comprises \n \nresponsible tax planning in line with the applicable laws. Tax infor\n-mation is provided professionally in connection with the annual and \nconsolidated financial statements, quarterly reports, and budgets. \n(Cross\n-border) transactions with affiliated companies are performed \nat arm‚s length and are consistent with OECD requirements. Our \nTransfer Pricing Guidelines and documentation are updated contin\n-uously and we do not artificially shift taxation; in other words, tax \nshould be paid where the value is created. We also use digital applica\n-tions to make tax processes more secure. \nThe CFO/the Board of Management is responsible for the oversight of \ntax issues. Compliance with regulatory requirements is ensured us\n-ing the Code of Conduct resolved by the Board of Management, by \nthe qualified staff in the tax department, and by deploying an effec\n-tive tax compliance management system (TCMS).\nThe Talanx Group links its tax policy with its sustainable develop\n-ment strategies by performing responsible tax planning that com\n-plies with the law. The economic and social impact of the tax policy \nare taken into account. The Talanx Group wants to make a fair \n \ncontribution as a responsible taxpayer.\n 207-2\n Group Taxes liaises regularly with the CFO, to whom the \n \nannual tax compliance report is also submitted. The full Board of \nManagement considers this issue to be highly important; this can \nclearly be seen, for example, from the facts that a tax compliance \n \nofficer has been appointed (2016), tax compliance was included in the \nCode of Conduct and taxes are also covered by the\n  whistle\n-blow\n-ing system\n. The taxes function is part of the general Group risk management \n \nsystem. Group Taxes uses a risk control matrix to capture and analyse \ntax risks on an ongoing basis, and reports these to Group Risk \n \nManagement. Risk mitigation measures and recommended actions \nare then developed on this basis.\n 207-3\n We engage in open dialogue with our internal and external \nstakeholders. Talanx aims to work together cooperatively with the \nfiscal authorities and discloses all information that is relevant for tax\n-ation. Equally, we take comprehensive measures to ensure that any \nduties of rectification are complied with. We are also an active \n \nmember of the GDV™s Tax Committee. \n\n50Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\n 207-4\n The following table provides an overview of the income \n \ntaxes paid and the income tax expense in 2019 for our key countries \n(not including the Hannover Re Group): \nINCOME TAXES PAID AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE (˛ˇ˜˚)\nFiscal jurisdiction\nIncome \ntaxes paid \n(EUR million) \n(Tax payment +, \n tax refund Œ)\nIncome\ntax expense\n (EUR million) \n(Tax expense +, \n tax income Œ)\nArgentina\n00Australia\n34Austria\n04Belgium00Brazil\n1310Canada\n01Chile0Œ2Colombia\n00Czech Republic\n00Denmark00France\n114Germany\n10794Great Britain\n00Greece\n23Hong Kong\n00Hungary\n01Ireland\n50Italy026Japan00Mexico\n106Netherlands02Norway\n00Poland\n4638Russia\n52Singapore\n00Slovakia\n00South Africa\n00Spain12Sweden\n12Swiss\nŒ10Turkey\n00United States\nŒ6Œ13Uruguay\n00Total\n196183 The income taxes paid generally differ from the income tax expense \nfor the year concerned. Among other things, this is due to the fact \nthat the income tax expense is influenced by issues that do not lead \ndirectly to cash inflows or outflows (such as the recognition of provi\n-sions for taxes). In addition, tax payments made in specific years may \nrelate to past or future periods. To this extent, the time at which tax \npayments are made does not correspond to the tax expense recog\n-nised for a particular period.\nHuman rights at Talanx\n 412-1\n As an international insurance group, Talanx hereby discloses, \nin accordance with section 54(5) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the \nsteps taken by the Group in the 2020 financial year to prevent forms \nof modern slavery and human trafficking. In addition, our Group \ncompanies in the United Kingdom and Australia are working on \n \ndetailed agreements relating to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.\nAs an international group with around 23,000 employees worldwide, \nwe are aware of the obligations towards our employees and business \npartners that result from our size and market position. In line with \nthis, Talanx has as its aim, and is committed to, respecting human \nrights worldwide in keeping with the applicable laws, conventions and \nregulations in this area; in addition, we actively support employee \nrights. Talanx has adopted a range of internal rules and regulations \ndesigned to ensure and review its compliance with human rights in \norder to underscore this commitment and make the importance of \ncompliance transparent for our employees and business partners. \nChief among these are the\n  Code of Conduct for Employees\n and the  Code of Conduct for Business Partners\n. The adoption of the revised Code of Conduct for Employees has also \nincreased the importance of the topic of human rights at Talanx. \n \nNobody in the Group may be forced to work as a result of any violence \nor intimidation. Fairness, politeness and respect for each and every \nindividual™s dignity and personal rights are key principles that are \n \nenshrined in Talanx™s Code of Conduct and form the basis for how we \ninteract with each other.\nA number of works agreements on human resources topics also exist. \nThe sections on the Code of Conduct, the whistle\n-blowing system (see \nthe relevant ﬁComplianceﬂ sections on\n  page 48 ff.) and the Code of \nConduct for Business Partners (see the section entitled ﬁSupplier \nmanagementﬂ on\n  page 105 f.) are particularly relevant in this \n context. \nTalanx™s diversity management also includes human rights aspects. \nDiversity involves a holistic approach that is based on the principles of \nuniversal human rights. Back in 2013, the Board of Management \nsigned the Diversity Charter, a corporate initiative designed to pro\n-mote diversity at companies and institutions. The Group promotes \ndiversity, combats discrimination and supports the development of \nits employees regardless of their age, ethnic origin, nationality, gender \nand gender identity, physical and mental abilities, religion, ideology, \nsexual orientation or social origin. In its\n  ﬁDiversity Commitmentﬂ\n, the Group Board of Management has undertaken to acknowledge, val\n-ue and incorporate diversity in Talanx™s corporate culture (see also the \nchapter ﬁTalanx as an employerﬂ). By signing up to the UN Global \nCompact, Talanx has undertaken to comply with international human \nrights. The first six of the initiative™s principles cover respect for \n \nhuman rights and the implementation of labour standards (the ILO \ncore labour standards). In addition to supporting international \n \nhuman rights, the Group has also pledged its commitment to free\n-dom of association, to make sure it is not complicit in human rights \nabuses, to eliminate force labour and child labour, and to eliminate \ndiscrimination in respect of employment and occupation. \n\n51Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nTalanx also gives particular support to seven out of the UN™s 17 \n \nSustainable Development Goals, focusing on those topics in which it \ncan make a concrete difference. These include SDG 5 (Gender Equality) \nand SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). \nIn addition, the Group explicitly takes human rights into account in \nits core business, i.e. investment (see also ﬁESG in asset managementﬁ) \nand underwriting. The regular RUC meetings (see also ﬁESG in insur\n-ance solutions") transparently identify and examine ESG aspects of \nunderwriting; in line with this, the committee also addresses human \nrights aspects, for example.\nAnti-corruption and anti-money laundering \nAnti-corruption\n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n Preventing corruption is an \n \nessential part of compliance management at Talanx. The Code of \nConduct contains concrete rules covering this area. Bribery and cor\n-ruption are not tolerated. Moreover, general and specific work \n \ninstructions exist to provide employees with specific rules of con\n-duct on, among other things, avoiding and disclosing conflicts of \ninterest; granting and accepting benefits, gifts and invitations; \n \ndonations and sponsorships; sideline activities; stakes in other com\n-panies and participations in transactions. \nThe rules for dealing with gifts from and to business partners are set \nout in a work instruction. This specifies that employees are obliged to \nkeep lists of gifts. These must be consolidated at departmental level \nand are systematically requested by the Compliance department. A \nrisk assessment for the organisation can then be performed by ana\n-lysing the lists of gifts (e.g. for type and frequency). Supplementary \nanti\n-corruption training serves to ensure that gifts are dealt with \n correctly.\nCompliance risk is identified using a process that features both top\n-down and bottom\n-up elements. Corruption is also a material compli\n-ance risk category. The units in the divisions draw up a compliance \nrisk profile documenting the individual risks involved, which is then \nchecked for plausibility using interviews with experts. In those areas \nthat have a higher risk profile due to the function performed, Group \nCompliance offers specialist anti\n-corruption training that is tailored \nto the activity in question. \nBoth the Talanx Group™s Code of Conduct and its Compliance Guide\n-lines highlight the need to avoid conflicts of interest. Unavoidable \nconflicts of interest must be disclosed to the employee™s line manag\n-er or the relevant compliance officer. In addition, the whistle\n-blower \nsystem allows conflicts of interest to be reported anonymously. Fail\n-ures to disclose conflicts of interest may constitute breaches of the \nCode of Conduct, the Compliance Guidelines or other specific rules, \nand may therefore represent violations of employees™ duties under \ntheir contracts of employment or service; they may also have civil \nlaw and labour law consequences for the employees concerned. \n \nPotential conflicts of interest are also identified by requesting the \nlists of gifts. In future there are plans to digitalise this process.\n 415-1\n In addition, Talanx™s Code of Conduct and its Compliance \nGuidelines contain rules on dealing with donations and sponsor\n-ships within the Group. For example, any donations to political \n \nparties may only be made within the statutory limits and must be \napproved in advance by Talanx AG™s Board of Management. \n Moreover, \nsome divisions have drawn up more detailed guidance on donations \nand sponsorships. \n 205-1\n The process for identifying compliance risks also provides \nfor compliance risk maps to be drawn up and used to derive risk\n- specific measures that are then included in the compliance plan. This \nalso applies to those risks that are assigned to the core compliance \ntopic of anti\n-corruption. Implementation of the anti\n-corruption \nmeasures specified for the Group is continuously monitored. Rele\n-vant examples of corruption risk include allegations of bribery and \ncorruption and of the acceptance and granting of benefits in connec\n-tion with invitations and gifts, purchasing and tendering, donations \nand sponsorships, and sales partners. In addition, corruption risk is \nregularly audited in the Group as part of the internal audit plan. \n 205-2\n The Talanx Group provides information and training on \n \nanti\n-corruption policies and procedures in a variety of formats. The \nannual compliance report informs the Board of Management and the \nSupervisory Board about significant compliance risks and the meas\n-ures taken to ensure that requirements are met. This also includes \nthe topic of anti\n-corruption. \nA mandatory web\n-based training (WBT) course on compliance and \nintegrity, which covers the topic of corruption, is used to educate all \nGroup employees in Germany. The relevant staff groups were also \ntrained in a number of virtual classroom\n-based training sessions. \nSince 2019, seminars focusing on integrity have been held for manag\n-ers several times a year; these are designed to raise awareness for val\n-ue\n-driven leadership and the impact on staff of positive role models. \nFurthermore, our foreign subsidiaries inform their staff about what \nanti\n-corruption is and the approaches that can be taken, regardless of \nwhich category individual employees belong to or where they are \n \nlocated. In addition, in\n-depth modules are provided via the various \ne-learning platforms. These use practical examples to illustrate the \ntopics and compulsory questions to reinforce the lessons learned. \nThe anti\n-corruption training programme is supplemented by infor\n-mation materials that are available to all staff on Talanx™s intranet.\n 205-3\n The Talanx Group did not become aware of any confirmed \nmaterial cases of corruption in the 2020 financial year.\n\n52Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nAnti-money laundering and prevention \n of terrorist financing \nThe entry into force of the European Union™s Fourth Anti\n-money \nLaundering Directive in 2015 led to a large number of additional \nmeasures being launched within the Group in order to ensure a coor\n-dinated approach to anti\n-money laundering and the prevention of \nterrorist financing. In addition, the ban on money laundering and \n \nillegal financing has been highlighted and attention drawn to the fact \nthat the competent anti\n-money laundering officer and Compliance \nOfficer must be informed of all suspected cases.\n 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n Adherence to anti\n-money launder\n-ing requirements and the prevention of terrorist financing are cov\n-ered by the monitoring guidelines forming part of the general com\n-pliance requirements. In addition, the Group Anti\n-money Laundering \nGuidelines set out the measures and processes to be used in prevent\n-ing money laundering. As a result, this topic is also reviewed by \nGroup Compliance and as part of the regular internal audits per\n-formed by Group Auditing. Continuous content reviews of the appli\n-cable compliance rules and regulations are performed and revisions \nmade where necessary (see also the section entitled ﬁComplianceﬂ, \n page 36 ff.).The Talanx Group™s anti\n-money laundering officers are responsible \nfor drawing up risk analyses. In addition, they develop work instruc\n-tions, report to the Board of Management, ensure staff training, and \nmonitor customer and policy portfolios. They serve as contacts for \nissues relating to the topic of anti\n-money laundering not only for all \nstaff but also for the law enforcement authorities and the Federal \n \nFinancial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\nData protection and cybersecurity\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n Information, like other key economic goods, is \nan important asset when operating an insurance company and needs \nprotecting. Insurers have a particular responsibility when it comes to \nprotecting information used to provide services to policyholders. This \nis also underscored by the fact that insurers that exceed a defined size \nthreshold are covered by section 8a of the German Act on the Federal \nOffice for Information Security (BSIG) and hence are classed as suppli\n-ers of critical infrastructure. This gives rise to legal obligations, and in \nparticular to the requirement to maintain the state of the art as \n \nregards information security for the systems operated. Information is \nthe basis for our daily work. Customer and employee data, and compa\n-ny and capital market information underpin a wide range of business \nprocesses. The basic principle with respect to personal data is that \nGroup employees may only capture, process and store such data if this \nis required for a specifically defined purpose and in the lawful perfor\n-mance of their duties, or if there is another legal basis for this. We \ntransfer personal data to external recipients (mainly service provid\n-ers) in order to enhance the efficiency of the services provided. At the \nsame time, external recipients must be seen as part of processing \n \noperations, e.g. in the case of brokers, appraisers, reinsurers and the \nlike. These external recipients are bound by contract and/or the law to \ncomply with the data protection requirements.\nTopic Boundary:\n Data protection and cybersecurity are relevant at all \nlevels of the Talanx Group, from divisions through departments down \nto individual employees. In addition, they can affect customers, busi\n-ness partners and suppliers in particular outside the Group. These \ndata are needed during the application process, to provide advice to \ncustomers, in underwriting, in customer and contract services, and in \nclaims and payment management. Additionally, personal data are col\n-lected, processed and stored in connection with human resources \nmanagement, shareholders and the funds business, among other \nthings.Impacts:\n Customers, employees and partners trust Talanx Group \ncompanies every day with sensitive data that must be processed \n \nresponsibly and in line with the legal requirements. However, there is \nalso considerable interest in this data outside the Company, for exam\n-ple in the context of industrial or corporate espionage targeting our \nindustrial clients, obtaining personal information about retail policy\n-holders or downloading employee details for improper use. Informa\n-tion security is a critical competitive advantage today, as well as being \nthe prerequisite for successful digital transformation.\n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n The Group™s Code of Conduct \n \nrequires all employees to comply with the provisions of data protec\n-tion law and the Group Data Protection Guidelines, and to actively \ncontribute to ensuring that personal data are reliably protected \nagainst unauthorised access.\nEnsuring that data are processed correctly is a material goal of the \nTalanx Group™s business activity. Averting hazards that threaten the \nintegrity, availability, confidentiality and authenticity of this informa\n-tion is the core task of information security. This means that the \n \nobjective of ensuring information security is on the same level as \n \nensuring functionality and economic efficiency. As a result, all Talanx \nGroup employees and partners must actively support and contribute \nto information security.\nThe Talanx Group has appointed company data protection officers as \nrequired by law. The data protection requirements to be observed \nhave been incorporated in a data protection management system. \nGroup guidelines lay down binding rules for the material data protec\n-tion requirements. We conduct awareness\n-raising measures and \ntraining, and perform random checks, on the basis of these Group \n \nrequirements. Centrally defined methods have been specified for \ndealing with data subjects™ rights (e.g. the right to access stored \n \npersonal data), ensuring that the processes are executed correctly. A \nsystem of reporting to senior management has been set up.\nOur online data protection tutorial presents the main principles to be \nobserved when processing personal data and explains the importance \nof data protection in employees™ day\n-to\n-day work. The training mod\n-ule is aimed at all Talanx Group employees in Germany, with the \n \nexception of the Hannover Re Group. Classroom training is offered \nand is also provided by the functions on request. In addition to con\n-sciously managing data protection risks, we use ongoing awareness \ncampaigns to sensitize employees to data protection issues.\n\n53Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nRegular, long\n-term training and awareness measures on information \nsecurity, which are tailored to specific target groups, are implemented \nas part of an awareness programme. The goal of this awareness pro\n-gramme is to ensure that all employees have a fundamental under\n-standing of the importance of information, of the threats to it and of \ninformation security, and to teach them to take a security\n-conscious \napproach in their daily work. \nIn addition, the programme is used to provide relevant departments, \nmanagement levels and individual functions with the special, \n \ntailor\n-made training they need on specific aspects, so as to boost the \neffectiveness of the information security management system.\nChanges to interpretations of the EU™s General Data Protection Regu\n-lation (GDPR) and of other statutory data protection requirements \n(e.g. as a result of court rulings and pronouncements by data protec\n-tion authorities) are assessed and communicated by the company \ndata protection officers. Individual interpretations or further details \nfrom the relevant authorities are still outstanding; these are being \nmonitored and must be implemented following a brief analysis. Com\n-plex data protection requirements were included in the internal audit \nplan. We have established a common data protection framework for \nthose branches and subsidiaries that are domiciled in the EU or the \nEuropean Economic Area (EEA). The branch or subsidiary concerned \nmust observe the national legal data requirements. In 2020, a network \nof data protection experts was established within the Talanx Group™s \nEuropean operations.\nInformation security plays an important role in the selection of, and \ncollaboration with, external service providers. For example, we re\n-quire service providers to comply with, and audit them to, the same \nstandards as our internal IT services.\nResponsibilities:\n The functions and projects can consult Group Data \nProtection on all data protection issues (access requests, deletion \n \nrequests, complaints and other submissions by data subjects). All \n \nemployees are free to approach Group Data Protection directly with \ninformation, suggestions or complaints, and absolute confidentiality \nis granted on request. Customers and business partners can find the \ncontact details for Group Data Protection on the websites. The depart\n-ment produces an annual activity report for the Board of Manage\n-ment of Talanx AG and the divisions providing information on the \naudits conducted, any weaknesses and defects revealed, and any \n \norganisational deficiencies that may still have to be remedied. Certain \ndata protection events and circumstances are reported to senior man\n-agement during the year.\nWe have established a data protection management system within the \nGroup (Primary Insurance Group and Reinsurance Group). The sys\n-tem that has been established is largely based on the requirements of \nthe GDPR. However, it has a number of different, target group\n-specific \nfocuses.\nThe data protection management system for the Primary Insurance \nGroup is implemented at Talanx AG, whereas Hannover Re is respon\n-sible for the data protection management system for the Reinsurance \nGroup. Within the Primary Insurance Group a distinction must be \nmade between two types of responsibility assigned, which are \n described below:\nGroup Data Protection is responsible for designing the data \n \nprotection management system for companies belonging to HDI \nDeutschland AG. It issues data protection requirements, imple\n-ments awareness\n-raising measures (training courses, etc.), monitors \ncompliance and assists in operational design (consulting), as well as \nreporting to senior management.\nHDI Global SE manages its data protection topics directly and allo\n-cates tasks and responsibilities centrally and locally. Local contacts \nhave been assigned responsibility for ensuring compliance with data \nprotection requirements. In some cases, the foreign locations have \nspecialist departments such as legal or compliance functions that \n \nactively perform data protection management. In the case of very \nsmall foreign locations that exclusively perform operational tasks, \ndata protection support by headquarters is being implemented.\nHDI International AG™s subsidiaries have implemented data protec\n-tion management activities at a local level and monitor their adequa\n-cy and effectiveness using established management tools. All subsidi\n-aries must prove that they meet the data protection requirements \napplicable to their processes, IT systems and interfaces and that they \nhave implemented all necessary organisational measures.\nIn the reporting period, we launched a structured question\n-naire\n-based survey at HDI Global SE™s and HDI International AG™s EU \nlocations with the objective of capturing the implementation status \nfor Group requirements. We aim to use the results to identify areas \nwhere \n enhancements are needed, along with areas in which the \nTalanx Group should conceivably perform detailed checks or provide \nconsulting.The business model used at Hannover Re gives rise to different risks \nthat need to be reflected in the data protection management system. \nThe principles documented in the Group Data Protection Guidelines \napply to all companies and units within Hannover Re. The Compli\n-ance organisation™s structures are used to implement these minimum \ndata protection law standards. Responsibilities have been established \nand documented throughout the Group. Interfaces to Data Protection \nManagement have been implemented. The GDPR does not affect all \nHannover Re companies equally, e.g. if they are domiciled outside the \nEU or the EEA. Above and beyond this, local data protection laws must \nbe observed.\nAligning our activities with the three lines of defence model, as an \nestablished good practice model for designing an information securi\n-ty organisation, is a major part of our information security strategy. \nThe model is implemented as a binding measure when defining roles \nand responsibilities as part of the process of documenting informa\n-tion security activities, as well as during operations in practice. One \nof its key aspects is the strict separation of responsibilities for imple\n-menting operational security measures on the one hand and for pre\n-scribing rules and frameworks on the other, so as to avoid conflicts of \ninterests.\n\n54Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\n 103-2| 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n Close cooperation and \n \nconsultation with important interfaces such as Group Legal, Group \nCompliance, Group Security and Group Auditing ensure that the data \nprotection legislation requirements are met. Data protection risks are \nreported to Group Risk Management.\nInformation security activities need to take into account the Compa\n-ny™s goals, the legal framework, economic criteria, information assets, \ncultural issues, technical possibilities and threat scenarios. Talanx™s \nstrategy is to identify, treat and manage risks resulting from these fac\n-tors by determining protection requirements in conjunction with \nsuitable risk analysis methods. Talanx complies with the international \nISO 27001 standard in the process, in the version applicable in each \ncase. Our information security management system has been fully \nISO 27001 certified since 2013 and undergoes an external review every \nyear, ensuring a high degree of transparency both within Talanx and \noutside it. This is flanked by ISAE 3402 measures (ISAE stands for the \nInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements) and the use \n of the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues published by Germany™s Federal \n \nOffice for Information Security (BSI). Since HDI Deutschland AG and \nHDI˜\n \nGlobal˜SE meet the Federal Republic of Germany™s critical infra\n-structure criteria, they have been linked to the central registry operat\n-ed by the GDV, the German Insurance Association, since 2018 and are \naudited every two years in line with the German Act on the Federal \nOffice for Information Security (BSIG).\n 418-1\n Group Data Protection at Talanx did not receive any notifica\n-tions of reportable data breaches or incidents in the reporting period.\nDigital transformation\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n Digital transformation is a material topic for the \nTalanx Group. It is a key strategic focus and part of the new Group \nstrategy. This provides a framework for the divisions to develop their \nown digital transformation strategies. In keeping with our decentral\n-ised Group structure, it is the divisions that drive the digital transfor\n-mation process.\nTopic Boundary:\n Digital transformation is relevant at all levels of the \nTalanx Group, from divisions through departments down to individu\n-al employees. We are guided in this process by the needs of our \n \ncustomers, business partners and suppliers.\nImpacts:\n The digitalisation of customer interfaces and functional \nunits affects both the top line and the bottom line of our business. \nNew, digital business models contribute significantly to growth and to \nenhancing profitability.\nAt Group level, this involves realigning the allocation of our resources \nand capital. Our strategy in this area includes both new partnerships \nand taking stakes in fintech, cyber and artificial intelligence (AI) \n companies. \nIn addition, as an increasingly digitalised insurer, Talanx needs to ad\n-dress new cyber risks that do not exist in this form in the traditional \ninsurance business. Among other things, we aim and need to be \n \nsensitive and ethically responsible in our dealings with customers™ \nand employees™ personal data when using new technologies.\nFinally, the progress made by digital transformation also impacts our \nhuman resources work. Our employee development and skills train\n-ing is focusing on an agile mindset and on growing the necessary \nmethodological expertise. Other requirements are resulting, for \n \nexample, from the automation of the application process and new \nways of interacting with candidates.\n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n One operational focus of our dig\n-ital transformation strategy is on upgrading our IT and systems envi\n-ronment to provide a basis for automation and for digitalising pro\n-cesses (ﬁget readyﬂ). The other two focus areas are content\n-related: \ndata analytics and behavioural economics (ﬁget skillsﬂ), and ecosys\n-tems/partnerships (ﬁget bundledﬂ). Since these focus areas are rele\n-vant for the entire Group, the holding company provides selective \nsupport for them as well, e.g. by facilitating international information \nsharing on, and scaling up, best practices and by entering into scout\n-ing and market intelligence partnerships.\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n Among other things, we con\n-tinued our Group\n-wide formats for sharing best practices on specific \nfocus areas in the reporting period and launched venture days featur\n-ing relevant start\n-ups and operating units.\n\n55Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nPAGE\nManagement approach\n 60ESG in asset management\n 63Sustainability of insurance products\n 66Principles for Sustainable Insurance\n 722\n56Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nThe 20 wind turbines in the Mahlwinkel wind farm produce \ngreen electricity for 25,000 \nhouseholds.

It has a total of 21 wind farms in its portfolio, \nthree of which are out at sea. Talanx was also involved in the financ\n-ing of the first offshore wind farm to use a green bond Œ ﬁGode \nWind˜1ﬂ in Germany™s North Sea. In 2017, the company again acted as \nlead manager for a bond pitched at institutional investors and banks \nfor the successor project, ﬁBorkum Riffgrund 2ﬂ. In 2020, Talanx™s \n \ninfrastructure specialists contributed their expertise to the partial \n \nfinancing of the ﬁHohe Seeﬂ and ﬁAlbatrosﬂ wind farms, coordinating \na green bond for Germany™s largest offshore wind farm project. All \nthree finance projects, which have a total volume in excess of EUR 1.9 \nbillion, meet independently audited green bond standards.\nDr Peter Brodehser, Head of Infrastructure at Ampega, Talanx™s asset \nmanagement company, is responsible at an operational level for \n \nfinancing wind farms. He and his team are constantly on the lookout \nfor attractive investments. However, the technology behind the tur\n-bines and the geographical location are not the decisive factors. Bro\n-dehser™s people are financial experts who look primarily at the yield \nrisk, focus on stable, reliably forecastable cash flows and \n prefer long \ndurations. ﬁThe great thing is that investments in wind turbines \nbring a twofold return Œ they benefit the environment and us as \n \ninsurersﬂ, Brodehser explains.\nThis is why Talanx decided to invest in the Mahlwinkel wind farm, \nwhich is located in the immediate vicinity of a former military air\n-field. The huge site, which is fringed by woods of larches, birches and \noak trees, is ideal for generating electricity from wind power. The \n \nrotor blades revolve 140 metres above the ground.\nPeter Brodehser \nwith Nadine Helzel, who is \nresponsible for \nlooking after \n the Mahlwinkel \nwind farm.\nOur investments \n in  sustainable  infrastructure projects \nsupport the transition \nto climate neutrality.\n\n58Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nThe wind farm is located outside the village of Mahlwinkel in the \n \nAltmark, roughly 50 kilometres north\n-east of Magdeburg. Twenty \nturbines produce green electricity here, including the massive 2.3 \nMW Enercon models that Talanx has operated since 2015. Talanx™s \nturbines in Mahlwinkel generate 90 million kw/h of green electricity \na year, enough for roughly 25,000 households. Talanx\'s investments \nin renewable energies generate a total of 2,660 million kWh of elec\n-tricity per year. This is enough for approximately 810,000 house\n-holds Œ roughly the size of a city like Munich.\nInvestments in renewables, and especially in wind power, are no \nlonger so simple as they used to be. The number of turbines con\n-structed in Germany is declining because suitable locations are be\n-coming harder to find and obtaining planning permission is getting \nmore difficult. At the same time, however, interest among banks and \ninstitutional investors in financing wind farms is increasing. This is \nwhere the network that Ampega has built up over the years comes \ninto its own. ﬁYou don™t find offers for new wind farms in the news-\npapers or on the Internetﬂ, says Brodehser. ﬁThey come through per\n-Michael Egger and Torsten \nKrakow from wind farm operator \nBayWa inside the shaft of a wind \nturbine.

The following \nlist provides an overview of other infrastructure areas in \nwhich policyholders™ capital is being invested:\nSolar power plants: \nTalanx has a total of seven solar \npower plants in its portfolio. For example, the Company \nprovided roughly EUR 250 million in finance for solar \npower plants in Spain in 2020. These help save roughly \n63,000 metric tonnes of carbon emissions a year.\nElectricity networks: \nTalanx also invests in power grids. \nThanks to its equity interest in transmission system \noperator Amprion, Talanx accounts for a material propor\n-tion of the billions of euros being invested in Germany™s \ngrid infrastructure as the country transitions to green \nenergy.\nFibre-optic projects:\n Talanx is changing the way \n electricity is transmitted in France, where it\'s helping to \nfinance fibre-optic links. The Group helped launch two \nsuch projects in 2020.\nRail networks: \nTalanx is also financing public rail net\n-works. Projects include an urban rail network (Tram de \nLiège in Belgium), regional transport (networks in Ulm) \nand long-distance transport (the LISEA high-speed \n \nnetwork in France), as well as co-finance for the \n Barcelona metro.\nHospitals and universities: \nTalanx also invests in social \ninfrastructure. This includes two hospitals in Portugal, \nprimary care centres in Ireland and Dublin university \n(Ireland).\nIn the control centre, BayWa sta˝ use \nup-to-the-minute wind forecasts to \nensure the electricity yield generated \nfrom wind energy for Talanx.\nand Bangkok. ﬁOur job is to minimise turbine downtimeﬂ, says \n \nMatthias Walter\n-Hobelmann, who happens to be on duty in the \n \ncontrol centre. He acts as the linchpin between technicians, network \noperators and maintenance crews.\nSuch coordination is particularly vital in winter, when there is a lot of \nsnow and ice around. And in spring and autumn, when cranes are \nmigrating, red kites circle in some areas and bats flit around in the \ndusk. Birdwatchers and farmers observe the wildlife very closely and \nreport them ahead of time. However, the turbines also anticipate \nsuch dangers using meteorological data and switch themselves off \nautomatically. The aim is to ensure that generating green electricity \ngoes hand in hand with species conservation as far as possible.\nBayWa sta˝ \nmanage the \nMahlwinkel wind \nfarm, among other \nthings, from the \ncontrol centre in \nMunich.\n\n60Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nInvestment \nand \n Insurance \nProducts\nManagement approach\n 203-2\n  Indirect economic impacts \nThe Talanx Group™s operations have a large number of indirect eco\n-nomic impacts. The insurance business is essentially about transfer\n-ring risk, which can mitigate losses that arise when loss events occur. \nThis means that insurers fulfil an important social role by enabling \nthe economy to function and providing financial security for indi\n-viduals. At an overall level, insurance cover can therefore secure \n \nsociety™s living standards and give enterprises the room to manoeuvre \nthey need to master challenges and be innovative.\nAdditionally, pre\n-emptive risk minimisation and loss prevention \n \nreduce the probability of losses and injuries, such as from fires or \nindustrial accidents. These aspects are essential in industrial insur\n-ance, for example. Among other things, this protects employees™ \nhealth and conserves natural resources. Talanx™s Accumulation Risk \nGeospacial Online System, or ARGOS for short, is a concrete example \nof how to safeguard against natural hazards. Talanx uses this inter\n-nally developed software system during site assessments to evaluate \npotential risks from a variety of natural hazards.\nAbove and beyond this, our hazard and risk analyses aim to identify \nexistential risk scenarios in all divisions and to take suitable meas\n-ures to reduce these to a level that ensures companies™ continued \nexistence. This applies to natural catastrophes (natcats), fire and ex\n-plosion protection, and engineering and marine insurance, as well as \nto business interruptions, which in today™s networked world may \nbecome more and more likely and take on an increasing order of \nmagnitude. We also raise awareness of the need for hazard assess\n-ments and sensible emergency planning. We work together with \nother enterprises in bodies such as the GDV to draw up guidelines \nfor the sustainable planning, establishment and operation of both \nplant and equipment and enterprises.\nAs insurers, we have always thought \nlong\n-term. This is why we developed \nsustainability focuses that ensure we \n \ninclude sustainability comprehensively \nwhat we do.\n\n61Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nIn addition, the Talanx Group has social and environmental impacts, \ndue in particular to its investments (\n  page 63˜ff.\n) and insurance \nproducts (\n  page 66˜ff.).On 27 November 2019, the European Council and the Parliament \npassed Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability\n-related disclo\n-sures in the financial services sector (SFDR). This requires financial \nmarket participants to disclose information on sustainable invest\n-ments and sustainability risks relating to financial products. Among \nother things, it requires the publication of information at the level of \nthe entity on the consideration of sustainability factors in invest\n-ment processes and in corporate strategy, and at the product level on \nsustainability impacts, e.g. in relation to the expected return. The \nTalanx companies covered by the regulation implemented the new \ndisclosure requirements in a first step as at the 10 March 2021 dead\n-line. Detailed information can be found on the websites for the \nTalanx Group companies concerned, e.g.\n  neue leben (German \nversion)\n.The SFDR sets out three categories of financial products: 1. Financial \nproducts promoting environmental or social characteristics (Art. 8: \nﬁlight greenﬂ), 2. Financial products with a sustainable investment \n \nobjective (Art. 9: ﬁdark greenﬂ) and 3. Other financial products.\nThe degree to which a product achieves its sustainability objective \nshould be quantified using indicators and compared against an index \nor benchmark. In addition, if a product aims at environmental sus\n-tainability taxonomy reporting must be performed with effect from \n2023. Furthermore, Article 7 of the SFDR specifies that a statement \nmust be provided for all products by 30 December 2022 as to whether \ntheir principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors (or PAIs for \nshort) have been considered. \nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facili\n-tate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 \n(EU Taxonomy Regulation) provides a binding definition of sustaina\n-ble activities for the first time. The EU™s intention is for the new frame\n-work to permit statements to be made in future about how the funds \ninvested by the financial sector are deployed.\n 102-11\n  Application of the Precautionary Principle \nThe UN™s Precautionary Principle sets out a prophylactic and for\n-ward\n-looking approach to environmental challenges and risks. As an \ninsurance undertaking, the Talanx Group also takes a prudent ap\n-proach to risk, and aims not to permit losses or damage Œ whether \nenvironmental or of other kinds Œ to occur in the first place. This can \nbe seen in a variety of areas and in our dealings with different stake\n-holders:\n Overall, the environmental impacts associated with the produc\n-tion of insurance cover are lower than those of production \nprocesses in other sectors. Nevertheless, we want to minimise \nthe negative impacts that our business activities have on the \nenvironment. For further details, see the chapter entitled \n \nﬁDay\n-to\n-Day Operations and Procurementﬂ (\n  page 91 ff.). The \nremaining sections in this chapter address how environmental \ntopics are incorporated into our core business. \n ﬁRisk managementﬂ covers the identification, assessment, \nanalysis, management and control of risks (\n  page 61) The ﬁResponsibility to customersﬂ section primarily addresses \ncustomer education (\n  page 67 ff.\n)  In addition, the Group\n-wide Code of Conduct and the Code of \nConduct for Business Partners apply (\n  page 105 f.) Moreover, the Talanx Group and the companies belonging to it \nare networked through their memberships of associations \n (  page 110 f.).Above and beyond this, a large number of units within the Group are \ninvolved in stakeholder communication; see the following section on \nrisk management and the materiality analysis (\n  page 26 f.). 102-29\n  Risk management\nWe see opportunity and risk management as one of our major \nstrengths. Monitoring and managing our risk position is part of the \nTalanx Group™s core business. Our objective is to avoid developments \nthat pose existential risks while at the same time taking advantage of \nopportunities that arise.\nAt the same time, our business activities also affect our environment \nand society (ﬁinside outﬂ). We address this through sustainability \nmanagement, for example by reducing our energy consumption, off\n-setting unavoidable emissions and requiring ethical conduct in our \ncodes of conduct for employees and business partners. Additional \ninformation on our ﬁinside out perspectiveﬂ can be found above all in \nthe chapter entitled ﬁSustainability Strategy and Managementﬂ\n (  page 12 ff.).We design our risk management framework on the basis of our cor\n-porate goals and guiding principles. As an international insurance \ngroup, we consciously enter into a large number of controlled risks \nthat are inextricably linked with our business activities and with cor\n-responding opportunities. Since risk management is part of our busi\n-ness activity, strategic risk targets are already set out in our business \nstrategy.\nWe use appropriate simulation models and processes to identify, \nquantify and manage risks and to determine risk capital require\n-ments. Information on qualitative risks is compiled systematically \nusing a Group\n-wide risk capture system. Risks spanning multiple \n \ndivisions, such as compliance risks, are addressed by involving the \nareas or experts concerned. To ensure that all risks are identified, \nthey are compared with a comprehensive risk categorisation system \nthat is specifically tailored to Talanx. In addition to this soft\n-ware\n-based risk capture procedure, the regular Risk Committee meet\n-ings are used to discuss the current risk situation. Talanx AG™s Board \nof Management also receives monthly updates on key risk indicators.\n\n62Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nDetailed information on risk management, and in particular on the \nkey people involved in the risk management process, can be found in \nthe risk report (\n  page 108 ff.) of the Group Annual Report 2020, and \nespecially in the following sections:\n ﬁRisk strategyﬂ \n ﬁRisk management systemﬂ \n ﬁRisk management process and communicationﬂ \n ﬁRisk profileﬂ\nFurther information can also be found in the\n  Solvency and \n \nFinancial Condition Report\n (SFCR) for 2020.\nRisk management also specifically addresses sustainability risks and \nespecially how these impact the Company and its business strategy \n(ﬁoutside inﬂ). These risks are ESG\n-related events or circumstances \nwhose actual or potential occurrence could have significant negative \neffects on the Company™s net assets, financial position and results of \noperations, and on its reputation. Sustainability risks affect all the \nrisk categories that we analyse. They can impact all areas of our busi\n-ness Œ both in the form of physical risks and as transition risks that \noccur during migration processes.\nFor example, climate change may increase underwriting losses. From \nan inside out perspective (see above), there is a risk that we could in\n-sure Œ and hence facilitate Œ projects that could endanger our sustain\n-ability goals. We address this conflict by working systematically to \nimplement our sustainability strategy and enhance our processes, \nand by regularly assessing insured projects at Board of Management \nlevel in the ﬁResponsible Underwriting Committeeﬂ.\nAs regards asset management, ﬁstranded assetsﬂ Œ i.e. assets whose \nincome-generating capacity or fair value could plummet unexpect\n-edly Œ could negatively impact the value of our investments. Since we \nare a large institutional investor, our market activities affect our abil\n-ity to achieve our sustainability goals. We have therefore taken a \nrange of measures; among other things, our Responsible Investment \nCommittee oversees our asset management activities. In addition, \nwe are aiming to expand our investments in projects with positive \nsustainability effects, such as wind farms and solar power projects.\nSustainability risks can also impact business operations, for example \nif critical infrastructure fails. We use a variety of measures such as \nmobile working to combat this.\nIn addition, reputational risks could arise since a range of stakeholder \ngroups are increasingly focusing as a matter of principle on how the \nTalanx Group takes social and environmental issues into account in \nits business operations.\n 102-29\n  Risks and opportunities due to climate change\nOur multidisciplinary, Group\n-wide risk management process also \ncovers environmental and social aspects. For example, risks associat\n-ed with climate change are classified as emerging risks, i.e. risks \nwhose risk content cannot yet be reliably assessed. Potential future \ndevelopments relating to these risks are taken into account in the \ncourse of risk management. It is vital to recognise them at an early \nstage and then to assess their relevance.\nPrimary insurance and reinsurance of losses from natural hazards \nare important elements of our business model as a global insurance \ngroup with a strong focus on industrial insurance and reinsurance. \nConsequently, climate change results in both opportunities and \nrisks for us. On the one hand, demand for insurance against natural \nhazards is likely to continue to increase, especially in previously un\n-derinsured growth regions. On the other hand, the risk of a negative \nfinancial impact from losses that have occurred will also increase. \nAssessing the probability of occurrence and impacts of natural dis\n-asters is becoming more difficult, since in the current exceptional \nclimatic situation historical data can only be used as inputs to a \n limited extent.\nThe risk content of new, future risks cannot be determined reliably at \npresent, and their impacts are difficult to assess. We have therefore \nimplemented a Group\n-wide emerging risks process so as to be able to \ncapture, assess and manage these risks at an early stage notwith\n-standing. Experts from all the divisions, including the Hannover Re \nGroup, analyse these risks regularly. The latest scientific findings on \nclimate change are always included in this process. In addition, liai\n-son with Risk Management ensures that any necessary measures can \nbe taken. These include, for example, ongoing monitoring and \n \nassessment, exclusions in insurance contracts or designing new (re\n-)insurance products.\nOur divisions also analyse such new risk types and trends. In doing \nso, they identify potential impacts and opportunities and develop \nproducts that are tailored to the relevant markets and customers; see \nalso the section entitled ﬁSustainability of insurance productsﬂ \n(  page 66 ff.). The divisions cooperate with each other on an ongo\n-ing, interdisciplinary basis. For example, we not only address how \nsustainability risks impact our Company but also analyse our effect \non society and the environment. This process takes into considera\n-tion the recent pronouncements by the Federal Financial Superviso\n-ry Authority (BaFin), the recommendations of the Task Force on \n \nClimate\n-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Principles for \nResponsible Investment (PRI), among other things.\nOur risk management system analyses how sustainability risks and in \nparticular risks resulting from climate change, affect all risk categories.\n\n63Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nESG in asset management \n 103-1\n Materiality: \nIn addition to its direct impacts (such as energy \nconsumption), the Talanx Group™s main way of influencing sustaina\n-ble development is through the leverage offered by its investments. \nThe Group™s investments under own management totalled EUR 128.5 \n(122.6) billion at the end of financial year 2020, while its total invest\n-ments amounted to EUR 138.9 (134.1) billion. A large majority of the \nTalanx Group\'s investments are in fixed\n-income securities, especially \ngovernment bonds and corporate bonds. Investors, analysts and cus\n-tomers are becoming increasingly interested in how Talanx takes so\n-cial and environmental aspects into account in its asset management \nactivities. The materiality analysis performed in 2018 revealed that \nincluding ESG aspects in the Talanx Group™s asset management deci\n-sions is a material topic. Such aspects are highly relevant for both \nstakeholders and the business, and significant environmental, eco\n-nomic and social impacts can be identified (see the ﬁMateriality anal\n-ysisﬂ section on \n page 26 ff.)Topic Boundary:\n Within the Talanx Group, this topic is primarily \n \nrelevant to those companies and departments that are involved in \ninvestments and asset management. Outside the Group, it affects \ncapital market participants such as investors and analysts, securities \nissuers and real estate providers. In addition, infrastructure invest\n-ments are relevant to the regions and sectors in which they are to be \nmade. \nImpacts:\n When making investments, the Group aims on the one \nhand to minimise potential negative impacts, for example by not in\n-vesting in certain countries or business areas. On the other hand, its \ngoal is to promote positive impacts overall. To do this, we developed \nan ESG screening procedure in 2016; see the section entitled \n \nﬁInclusion of environmental and social criteria in investment \n selectionﬂ (\n  page 64). 103-2\n Measures and guidelines: \nThe alternative investments \n \nasset class is becoming increasingly important in the ongoing low \ninterest rate environment, as it helps enhance returns and diversify \nthe portfolio. Alongside real estate and private equity, Talanx™s main \nfocus here is on investing in infrastructure projects; see the section \nentitled ﬁInfrastructure investmentsﬂ (\n  page 65).The divisions are also active in this area. For example, Industrial Lines \nis currently investing in renewable energies such as wind, solar and \nhydropower, both in Germany and in the rest of Europe. Retail Ger\n-many offers another infrastructure investment component in the \nform of a solar power fund.\nAll of HDI Lebensversicherung AG™s fund policies (both new and exist\n-ing business) offer two actively managed internal portfolios with a \nsustainability focus. The ﬁISP\n-Zukunftﬂ and ﬁMF Zukunftﬂ portfolios \n(for policies from 2012 onwards/new business and older policies/exist\n-ing business respectively) and the ﬁISP Trend ESGﬂ portfolio (for poli\n-cies from 2021 onwards), all of which belong to the ISP product family, \ncomprise sustainable and environmentally friendly investments. \nThe investment strategy aims to offer investors long\n-term capital \ngrowth based on a broadly diversified, actively managed securities \nportfolio, while putting a particular focus on ethical, social and envi\n-ronmental aspects. The underlying principle is that sustainable \n \ndevelopment can only be achieved if environmental, economic and \nsocial objectives are pursued at the same time and are accorded equal \nimportance. The target funds in this internal insurance portfolio are \nselected using data from ESG research provider Sustainalytics and \nfrom ﬁForum Nachhaltige Geldanlagenﬂ.\nAmpega Investment, Talanx™s asset management company, offers \n \nretail funds for which sustainability is an important investment crite\n-rion. These have integrated a combination of negative screening cri\n-teria and best\n-in-class approaches with their bond and equity fund \ninvestment processes. Offerings developed for institutional clients \ncan incorporate tailor\n-made sustainability requirements (e.g. specific \nnegative screening criteria). The criteria used are based on data from \nSustainalytics. In addition to the Ampega Responsibility Fund, \n \nAmpega offers the terrAssisi Renten I AMI and terrAssisi Aktien I AMI \ninvestment funds as sustainable focus products. These funds invest \nin target funds or enterprises and issuers that include environmental \nand social as well as economic criteria in their long\n-term corporate \nstrategies, and that are considered to be pioneers in assuming \n \nresponsibility for the future. Independent research agencies such as \nISS-ESG analyse the securities for compliance with the sustainability \ncriteria. \nSince April 2015, Ampega has offered Ampega Diversity Plus Aktien\n-fonds Œ a product that invests in European companies for which pro\n-moting and valuing employee diversity is a key priority.\nResponsibilities:\n The Talanx Group™s investment services are provid\n-ed by Corporate Operations and within this segment by three compa\n-nies: Ampega Investment GmbH, Ampega Asset Management GmbH \nand Ampega Real Estate GmbH. Ampega Investment GmbH is an \n \nasset manager serving retail and institutional investors. Its product \nrange comprises both multi\n-award\n-winning retail investment funds \nand special funds. The company also manages asset portfolios and \nfinancial portfolios for non\n-Group clients. It offers a broad range of \nfunds designed to permit state\n-of-the-art asset management and \n \ndynamic retirement provision. Ampega Asset Management GmbH is \nresponsible for the Talanx Group\'s investments in the money, capital \nand real estate markets and is therefore a key point of contact for sus\n-tainable investments within the Group. Its team of infrastructure in\n-vestment specialists is particularly worth mentioning. Ampega Real \nEstate GmbH manages the Talanx Group\'s real estate investments. \nEffective March 2021, the formerly independent Ampega Real Estate \nhas been integrated with Ampega Asset Management.\n\n64Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n The Responsible Invest\n-ment Committee (RIC) provides support for putting our sustainable \ninvestment strategy into practice. One goal that was established \nwhen implementing this strategy was to screen investments using an \nexternal service provider that specialises in sustainable investing. \nThe RIC discusses and resolves the filter criteria used in ESG screen\n-ing. This process also includes making regular updates to the cata\n-logue of criteria. The decisions made by the committee serve as input \nfor the Group\n-wide Sustainable Investment Guidelines.\nThe committee is chaired by Talanx AG™s Chief Financial Officer \n(CFO). Other members include the segment CFOs and investment \nmanagers, the head of Group Communications, the head of Investor \nRelations and Ampega Asset Management™s senior management.\nIn addition, external evaluations provide relevant feedback when \n \nassessing specific financial products. We also obtain stakeholder \nfeedback on material topics, and on the measures we are taking and \nthe progress being made, in the course of our regular stakeholder \n \ndialogue; see also the ﬁMateriality analysisﬂ section (\n  page 26 ff.).Inclusion of environmental and social criteria in \n investment selection\n 201-2 | 203-2 | 412-3 | FS11\n When making investment decisions, \nTalanx AG aims on the one hand to avoid potential negative impacts \nby not investing in unsustainable issuers. To do this, we developed a \nGroup\n-wide ESG screening process in 2016 and implemented it at the \nbeginning of financial year 2017. On the other hand, the Talanx Group \nalso aims to promote positive impacts on society and the environ\n-ment (for further details, see the section entitled ﬁInfrastructure in\n-vestmentsﬂ on \n page 65).ESG screening is performed every six months by an external service \nprovider. In the course of this process, almost 90% of all Talanx \nGroup investments under own management Œ depending on strate\n-gic allocation changes Œ are communicated to the service provider \nand rated, to the extent that a rating exists. The RIC defines the filter \ncriteria used and makes individual decisions on whether to retain or \ndivest holdings. Any decision taken to divest holdings that do not \ncomply with the screening criteria should generally be implemented \nby the end of the year.\nThe RIC has specified compliance with the UN Global Compact as one \nof the filter criteria to be used. In addition to these ten universal prin\n-ciples, which relate to the areas of human rights, labour standards, \nthe environment and anti\n-corruption, we have added investments in \ncontroversial weapons such as anti\n-personnel mines to the list of \nscreening criteria. Building on this, an expanded global standards \nscreening procedure identifies issuers who infringe international \nnorms and standards, such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational \nCorporations or the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. In 2018, \nthe list of screening criteria was expanded to include coal. We no \nlonger invest in companies that derive more than 25% of their reve\n-nue or generate more than 25% of their power from coal. In line with \nthe Talanx Group™s sustainability strategy, in which we have set our\n-selves the goal of exiting coal entirely by 2038, we are limiting the \nduration of our investments in this area to that year. We also extend\n-ed our list of screening criteria in 2019 to include oil sands. The new \nscreen excludes companies that generate more than 25% of revenues \nfrom this source. We also check before making new securities pur\n-chases whether the issuers meet our ESG criteria.\n The RIC met twice in 2020, as in the previous year. Where no obsta\n-cles to sale existed, the positions identified were liquidated by the \nend of the year.\nWe have also defined negative screening criteria as part of the selec\n-tion process for alternative asset classes (e.g. infrastructure invest\n-ments and real estate). In addition to classic criteria relating to \n \ninvestments™ risk/return profile, the screening process includes a \nsustainability risk assessment. No investments may be made in \n \nnuclear power projects, projects involving animals (e.g. zoos and \n \nsafari parks), assets involving significant levels of pollution or assets \nassociated with controversial business models (e.g. gambling). In the \ncase of real estate investments by the Group, the goal for direct pur\n-chases is to invest in buildings that have been certified as sustaina\n-ble (e.g. that have been awarded DGNB, LEED or BREEAM certificates). \nSuch certification schemes cover properties™ environmental, eco\n-nomic, sociocultural and functional aspects, among other things. In \naddition, Ampega has been an active member of the ESG Circle of \nReal Estate (ECORE), which is developing a sustainability standard for \nthe sector, since the association was formed.\nTo further underscore our commitment to sustainable investment, \nAmpega Asset Management GmbH Œ our asset management subsid\n-iary Œ followed our example in 2020 and signed up to the United \n \nNations™ Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).\n\n65Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nClimate strategy\nOur goal is to continuously fine\n-tune our sustainability approach. In \nline with this, the focus in 2020 was on developing a medium\n- to \nlong\n-term climate strategy, especially in relation to the carbon foot\n-print for our investments. We determined the carbon footprint for \nour portfolio for the first time in 2020, in keeping with the Paris cli\n-mate goals and the principle of avoiding, reducing and offsetting our \nown CO\n2 emissions set out by Talanx in 2019. Our focus here was on \nthe carbon intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2) of our liquid assets under \nown management in the equities and fixed income areas. Our goal is \nto reduce this figure by 30% compared to the beginning of 2020 in \nthe period up to 2025; this corresponds to reducing the carbon inten\n-sity by roughly 7% per annum. This current target is an important \nstep towards developing a sustainable, long\n-term path towards car\n-bon neutrality by 2050. In the medium term, we are aiming to meas\n-ure and reduce carbon emissions for other asset classes, including \n \nilliquid ones. We shall provide additional information on our ongo\n-ing progress in implementing our climate strategy in our sustainabil\n-ity reports for coming years. Our climate strategy is developed and \nadapted in line with the current political, economic, technological \nand social framework, which means that changes may have to be \nmade to the system behind it. For example, we are considering in\n-cluding Scope 3 emissions data in the future, but this currently can\n-not be implemented across the board, and therefore does not make \nsense, due to the insufficient quality of the data available. In addition \nto reducing our portfolio™s carbon footprint, we want to invest in \n \nassets that help to combat climate change; these include in particular \nour investments in renewable energies and in strengthening and \n \nexpanding public transport see following section ﬁInfrastructure \n investmentsﬂ.\nInfrastructure investments\n 203-1 | 203-2\n Talanx has already been indirectly invested in infra\n-structure projects for some time via funds. The Group has systemati\n-cally built up its expertise in this area in recent years and a new, spe\n-cialised unit has also participated in selected projects directly since \nthe beginning of 2014, providing both equity and debt. At present, \nour diversified infrastructure portfolio includes, among other things, \ninvestments in (onshore and offshore) wind farms, solar farms (pho\n-tovoltaic Œ PV Œ power plants), power grids, transport infrastructure, \npublic\n-private partnership (PPP) projects and communications infra\n-structure projects in Germany and the rest of Europe.\nInfrastructure projects address a population™s basic needs. Demand \nfor investments in core infrastructure goods is largely immune to \n \ncyclical economic effects and is highly plannable for institutional in\n-vestors. At the same time, the projects are a good fit for an insurer™s \nlong\n-term investment horizon. These carefully selected projects offer \nattractive returns for an acceptable level of risk. In addition, they are \nnot strongly correlated with conventional asset classes. The goal at all \ntimes is to make sound, sustainable investments in the interests of \nour policyholders. One of our core selection criteria for investments \nis a regulated environment, e.g. in the form of statutory feed\n-in fees, \nincentive\n-based regulation and PPP concession regimes. Most infra\n-structure investments are made within the eurozone.\nThe volumes planned for direct infrastructure investments are \n \nbetween EUR 50 million and EUR 150 million per project (equity) and \nEUR 50 million and EUR 250 million (debt); the investment horizon is \nroughly five to 30 years.\nAs of the end of 2020, Talanx had directly invested a total of approxi\n-mately EUR 3.7 (2.5) billion in infrastructure projects. Roughly EUR 2 \nbillion of this figure is attributable to renewable energy sources. This \nunderscores Talanx™s pioneering role in the transition towards green \nenergy.\nStrengthening and expanding public transport is another key ele\n-ment in meeting the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement. \nIn 2020, Talanx started financing the metro in Barcelona. This invest\n-ment supplements the Company™s existing investments in the rail \nsector (e.g. in the high\n-speed rail link infrastructure in France and in \nregional rail transport in Germany). Strengthening public mobility in \nthe area of rail transport is a key element of a sustainable future.\nOver time, we aim to increase the sector diversification of our infra\n-structure portfolio. For 2021, we expect new equity and debt invest\n-ments in infrastructure projects to total approximately EUR 300 mil\n-lion to EUR 500 million.\n\n66Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nSustainability of insurance products\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n The ﬁsustainability of insurance productsﬂ \n \ntopic area is material for the Talanx Group (see the section entitled \nﬁMateriality analysisﬂ on \n page 26 ff.\n) and can be broken down into \ntwo areas. On the one hand, it addresses customer concerns and has \na significant influence on their satisfaction, which in turn is decisive \nfor the Talanx Group™s success. Issues include rapid, transparent \nclaims processing, financial incentives for fair sales advice in the \n \nremuneration system and easy\n-to\n-understand information about in\n-surance solutions. On the other hand, the topic area covers the inclu\n-sion of ESG topics in insurance solutions. This means that insurance \nproducts are reviewed for their environmental and social impact and \ntheir relevance to sustainable development.\nTopic Boundary:\n Customer interests and satisfaction are key issues \nfor the entire Talanx Group. Internally, product topics mainly play a \nrole for the divisions in relation to organising the insurance business, \nwhile externally they are relevant for (potential) customers, business \npartners and intermediaries. Above and beyond this, the insurance \nbusiness can also indirectly impact interest groups that are not \n \ndirectly involved in the value chain.\nImpacts:\n Customer satisfaction is a critical success factor for the \nTalanx Group. Consequently, meeting customer needs is paramount; \nthis is also reflected in the Talanx Values with their reference to ﬁcom\n-prehensive customer orientationﬂ. Transparency, fairness, and inno\n-vative, customer\n-oriented products and services are key elements. \nThe use of highly\n-tailored services is one of the main ways of address\n-ing customer requirements. Examples are active, direct support from \nour service providers to assist with crisis communications in the case \nof cyber attacks, and ensuring staff safety during business trips. In \naddition, customers may react positively to the inclusion of social \n \nissues and support for environmentally friendly products and pro\n-jects, since social awareness of sustainability is growing. Customer \nsatisfaction can also improve employee satisfaction and identifica\n-tion with their employer.\nThe Talanx Group\'s insurance services do not have any direct rele\n-vant environmental impacts. Rather, these services help ensure that \nenvironmental risks are adequately insured and that the impact of \nany damage can be remedied or mitigated. The insurance business \nessentially has a positive social impact Œ it involves transferring risk \nso that losses arising from loss events can be absorbed and financial \nprotection can be provided for both entities and individuals.\nNevertheless, the potential indirect environmental and social im\n-pacts of the insurance business on sustainable development, such as \nany consequences that insured projects may have, must be borne in \nmind. For example, the Talanx Group is withdrawing from insuring \ncoal risks over time. By doing so, the Company is underscoring its \ncommitment to transitioning to a lower\n-emissions economy and \ncomplying with the goals of the Paris Agreement, which it supports. \nAs an insurance partner for industrial enterprises, the Talanx Group \nwill work with customers to find constructive ways to strengthen cli\n-mate protection. Talanx™s long\n-term goal is to incorporate sustaina\n-bility aspects into its insurance products and services to a greater \nextent. The decision to put COVID\n-19 on the same footing as the dis\n-eases and pathogens listed in the German Protection Against Infec\n-tion Act (IfSG) means that business shutdowns that are officially or\n-dered as a result of the coronavirus pandemic enjoy insurance cover. \nAs a result, HDI Germany made a major contribution to society dur\n-ing this period. \n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n The Talanx Group already has a \nlarge number of measures and guidelines in place covering the mate\n-rial topics of rapid, transparent claims processing, financial incen\n-tives for fair sales advice in the remuneration system and easy\n-to\n-un-derstand information about insurance solutions (see the sections \nentitled ﬁResponsibility to customersﬂ (\n  page 67 f.\n) and ﬁESG in in\n-surance solutionsﬂ (\n  page 70 ff.).Responsibilities:\n Group\n-wide and sector\n-wide requirements exist for \norganising the insurance business and designing insurance products. \nThe Code of Conduct sets Group\n-wide standards for responsible and \nethical behaviour and lays down the rules to be observed in relation \nto topics such as financial sanctions and embargoes, anti\n-money \nlaundering and sales compliance. Comprehensive compliance train\n-ing is held, with a particular focus on sales compliance and prevent\n-ing corruption; see also the ﬁComplianceﬂ management approach\n (  page 47 ff.\n). In addition, sector\n-specific initiatives such as the \nGDV™s Code of Conduct for Insurance Distribution play a key role in \nthe insurance business; see the ﬁResponsibility to customersﬂ section \nbelow.\nThe divisions are responsible for implementing guidelines, for strate\n-gy and for developing products and services; see also the section en\n-titled ﬁDivisions, products and brandsﬂ (\n  page 8). 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n The insurance companies \nbelonging to the Talanx Group use a variety of instruments to track \ncustomer satisfaction; see the section entitled ﬁResponsibility to cus\n-tomersﬂ below. We have ensured the quality of our working processes \nand results by implementing an ISO 9001\n-certified quality manage\n-ment system (QMS) at individual Group companies, e.g. in bancassur\n-ance and at HDI Life and HDI Property. This allows us to meet our \ncustomers™ and partners™ requirements and expectations for the long \nterm. The core principle is systematic customer and process orienta\n-tion. All necessary operational processes are reviewed regularly for \ntheir optimisation potential. This process of continuous improve\n-ment ensures that customers receive consistent service at all times \nand secures the organisation™s long\n-term competitiveness.\n\n67Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nResponsibility to customers\n 102-43 | 102-44\n A variety of tools are used to assess customer satis\n-faction. The Retail Germany Division performs customer satisfaction \nsurveys at a number of different customer contact points using a \nmeasurement and management system that was introduced in 2012. \nIn addition, cross\n-divisional pilot surveys have been conducted; ide\n-ally, these will lead in future to a uniform survey methodology and \nuniform basic questions (alongside the division\n-specific surveys and \nquestions). Customer and intermediary satisfaction is also moni\n-tored using a number of annual surveys, e.g. the customer monitor, \nthe YouGov tied agents™ survey, the HEUTE UND MORGEN commer\n-cial insurance customer check, and the ﬁKUBUSﬂ studies (ﬁKunden\n-orientiertes Benchmarking von Prozessen für die Unternehmens\n- \nSteuerungﬂ Œ Customer\n-oriented Benchmarking of Corporate \nManagement Processes) conducted by MSR. \nAbove and beyond this, a large number of companies perform their \nown customer satisfaction surveys for their own areas, which are \nsteered and supported by the internal Market Research unit. One par\n-ticularly noteworthy example is the customer satisfaction survey \nthat is performed at the end of the loss adjustment process at HDI™s \nthird\n-party liability, accident and property claims unit and its motor \nvehicle claims unit. In addition to the regular MSR satisfaction sur\n-veys, an e\n-mail poll of claims customers (policyholders and claim\n-ants) was successfully piloted. The goal is to extend the survey in \n \nfuture to all areas of the Retail Germany segment (including bancas\n-surance) and to introduce uniform monitoring. Following the intro\n-duction of the ﬁHDI CRMﬂ programme and its ﬁStudioﬂ software com\n-ponent, in\n-house customer satisfaction surveys are being piloted in \nthe claims units without the involvement of external service provid\n-ers. In the future, the plan is for all other HDI Germany departments \nto perform in\n-house customer satisfaction surveys. Customer service \nand call centre operations also already perform net promoter score \nsurveys to measure customer satisfaction at our bancassurance \nunits. In addition, neue leben uses a regular survey to measure satis\n-faction at partner, shareholder and other cooperating savings banks.\nOther external tools can also be used to measure customer satisfac\n-tion and assess the Talanx Group\'s performance. There are a large \nnumber of these on the topic of insurance, e.g. in newspapers and \nspecialist magazines. We also use the dialogue with our stakeholders \nduring our sustainability management activities to gather feedback \nand identify the material challenges currently facing the Talanx \nGroup.\nEqually, Talanx™s international companies take a large number of \nsteps to measure customer satisfaction and ensure service quality \nand performance for the long term. \nEasy-to-understand information about insurance solutions\n 417-1\n The German Regulation on Information Obligations for \n \nInsurance Contracts (VVG\n-InfoV) imposes extensive duties on the in\n-surance industry to inform their customers, and Talanx naturally \ncomplies with these. Above and beyond this, providing easy\n-to\n- understand information about insurance solutions is a key part of \nthe  Code\n, to which the relevant Group companies belong. The \n \nrevised Code aims to present a sector\n-wide standard for fair, \nneeds\n-driven customer advice.\nThe fifth principle set out in the Code requires insurance products to \nbe developed and sold on a needs\n-driven basis. Simple, easily under\n-standable product documentation should give customers the confi\n-dence to make conscious choices that are right for them. One of the \nmain ways in which Group companies ensure clarity and under\n-standability in the retail business, for example, is by using a product/\nconsumer information sheet. This sheet scores positively on the \n \nHohenheimer Verständlichkeitsindex, a German readability index. \nThe general terms and conditions for insurance policies, the annual \nlife insurance policy statements and the sample calculations for life \ninsurance are also based on the GDV recommendations. Following \nthe introduction of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD), man\n-ufacturers of insurance products have to comply with more exten\n-sive supervisory and management requirements, which the compa\n-nies in the Retail Germany Division comply with. Products are \ndeveloped using standardised creation and consultation processes, \nincluding uniform readability specifications. The bancassurance \ncompanies have also implemented the clarity and understandability \nguidelines contained in the GDV™s Code of Conduct, and have supple\n-mented them by brand\n-specific requirements. This means that in \nsome cases our bank partners™ requirements already exceed those \ncontained in the Code of Conduct. It goes without saying that HDI \nGlobal SE also scrupulously observes the extensive statutory require\n-ments resulting from the IDD.\nThe third principle sets out that all recommendations made must re\n-flect customers™ objectives, wishes and needs. HDI obliges its tied \nagents and banking partners to put ascertaining these needs during \nconsultations at the heart of their brokerage activities. In addition, \nconsultations have to be carefully documented using standardised \nreport forms. This is monitored by Complaints Management. Confir\n-mation from customers that they have received a record of the advice \nprovided is an integral part of our application/contract documenta\n-tion. The standardised digital sales processes provided by HDI and \nthe automated advisory processes also include documentation of the \nconsultation, which is made available to customers. Giving custom\n-ers easy\n-to\n-understand information and focusing on their needs are \nalso a component of independent reviews and audits. A sales compli\n-ance management system was developed and implemented for the \nsales forces at HDI Versicherung AG, HDI Lebensversicherung AG and \nour bancassurance companies to ensure that the Code is properly im\n-plemented. This is regularly recertified by independent auditors.\n\n68Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nIn bancassurance™s core biometric risk business, the sector (including \nthe bancassurance companies in the Retail Germany Division) imple\n-mented the new statutory requirements introducing additional \ntransparency requirements and enhanced consumer rights at the \nbeginning of 2018. In line with this, consumers are informed that \npayment protection insurance is voluntary and is not a precondition \nfor being granted a loan. Consumers have the right and the opportu\n-nity to terminate the agreement at any time throughout its life. They \nreceive a repeat cancellation policy notice for the payment protec\n-tion insurance policy, plus the relevant product data sheets, at the \nearliest one week after the loan contract has been entered into. This \nnotice draws customers™ attention to the fact that they can withdraw \nfrom the payment protection insurance policy without this impact\n-ing the loan. Customers can exercise their right of withdrawal within \n30 days of receiving the renewed cancellation policy notice. If the pol\n-icy is cancelled, it is voided ab initio at no cost to the customer. Even \nafter this, consumers can terminate the policy at any time, in which \ncase the unused pro rata portion of their premium is refunded. Addi\n-tionally, the GDV and the banking associations have developed vol\n-untary undertakings designed to increase transparency even further. \nThe bancassurance companies actively support these efforts. A large \nproportion of the banking partners for the Group™s bancassurance \ncompanies (Hamburger Sparkasse AG, a number of smaller savings \nbanks, SKP, Postbank Œ a branch of DB Privat\n- und Firmenkunden\n-bank AG, and TARGOBANK AG) already disclose in their loan agree\n-ments not just the loan instalment payment but, for comparative \npurposes, the loan instalment payment that would be due if no pay\n-ment protection insurance were payable. As a result, customers can \ndirectly see the monthly charge attributable to the payment protec\n-tion insurance policy in addition to the amount explicitly disclosed \nin the agreement. \nTalanx™s international companies develop, modify and sell products \non the basis of internal processes. In particular, we take the necessary \nmeasures when developing and selling products to ensure that the \nlaw is complied with. Customers are provided with comprehensive, \ndetailed product information, while products are properly labelled \nand comply with all other legal requirements.\nAbove and beyond this, Talanx helps promote financial education \nthrough the HDI Foundation, among other things. This awards schol\n-arships to students of insurance\n-related subjects; see also ﬁWork and \nEmployeesﬂ (\n  page 73). 417-2 | 417-3| 419-1\n Talanx is not aware of any cases in the reporting \nperiod in which regulations or codes of conduct relating to product \ninformation or labelling were not complied with. The same applies to \nthe sale of prohibited or controversial products and to failure to com\n-ply with regulations or voluntary advertising codes.\nThe Group companies™ normal business activities may involve them \nin court and regulatory proceedings, and arbitration cases. In the re\n-porting period and at the reporting date there were no legal disputes, \nother than proceedings customary to the insurance and reinsurance \nbusiness, with a material impact on the Group™s net assets, financial \nposition and results of operations. See also the \n ﬁLitigationﬂ sec\n-tion of the Group Annual Report 2020, \n( page 232\n). After the squeeze\n-out (i.e. the transfer of the shares belonging to minority shareholders \nto the majority shareholder in return for cash compensation) at \n \nGerling\n-Konzern Allgemeine Versicherungs\n-AG, Cologne, that was \n \nresolved in September 2006 and took effect in May 2007, former \n \nminority shareholders launched judicial review proceedings (ﬁSpruch-\nverfahrenﬂ) regarding the appropriateness of the compensation. The \nproceedings are pending before the Regional Court in \n Cologne. The \nmaterial risk is limited to the number of shares entitled to receive \ncompensation (approximately 10 million shares) and the difference \nbetween the compensation already paid and the enterprise value of \nGerling\n-Konzern Allgemeine Versicherungs\n-AG, which can be calcu\n-lated as of the valuation date. In our opinion, the various provisions \nfor litigation risks and the contingent liabilities for litigation that have \nbeen disclosed cover the expected expenses.\n\n69Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nRapid, transparent transaction processing\nThe individual divisions have defined service levels to ensure rapid, \ntransparent processing of customer transactions. These are used \nwith sales partners (in the form of service level agreements). They \n \ndefine workflows for the service times for certain transactions, which \nare discussed annually with customers. The objective here is to safe\n-guard and improve competitiveness. \nIn 2015, the Retail Germany Division launched its multiyear ﬁKuRSﬂ \n(ﬁKundenorientiert Richtungsweisend Stabilﬂ Œ Customer\n-oriented, \nForward\n-looking, Stable) programme. The initiative aims to stabilise \nthe division, improve its long\n-term competitiveness and hence make \nit fit for the future. Implementation is focused on optimising busi\n-ness processes and increasing service quality for customers and sales \npartners. This also includes modernising the division™s IT and en\n-hancing transparency with regard to its portfolio data and costs. In \n2016, work began on a project to harmonise the application environ\n-ment. The objective is to establish a common portfolio management \nsystem for HDI Deutschland AG and the life and accident business. In \nthe period since 2017, products and new business for the other HDI \nDeutschland AG companies were transferred to the common portfo\n-lio management system. In addition, we decided to realign our life \ninsurance business: among other things, traditional classic life insur\n-ance products were replaced by capital\n-efficient concepts in 2016.\nThe first effects of the programme can be seen among other places in \nHDI™s claims function: the claims app in the third\n-party liability, acci\n-dent and property claims unit and the motor vehicle claims unit, and \nthe FAST live calculation tool for motor vehicle claims allowed major \nsteps towards optimising existing processes and application environ\n-ments to be taken and built on. Elements of the digital transforma\n-tion process and opportunities for enhanced customer contact are \nboth being incorporated into the claims management process. \n \nMachine learning and automation are substantially accelerating dig\n-ital processes in claims management. This started in 2020 with the \nlights\n-out processing of glass invoices in the motor vehicle claims \narea. Customer service quality was enhanced by further optimising \nexisting processes from the active claims management perspective, \nsuch as providing needs\n-driven customer support in the case of \n \ncyberattacks. Another method of enhancing service quality is by an\n-choring a tailor\n-made service story among employees Œ the focus \nhere is on ensuring that all claims staff take a positive approach to \ncustomers in every claim. Another way that the claims units are \nmeeting this goal is by extending lean management in the direction \nof agile working, using methods including best practices, structured \nproblem solving, and feedback and team sessions. Rapid, transparent \nclaims processing is ensured by cross\n-departmental professional co\n-operation where sensible in the third\n-party liability, accident and \nproperty claims area, plus further streamlining of the Retail Property \nInsurance claims centre. What is more, all claims units achieve the \nobjective of completing claims processing on first contact as flexibly \nand rapidly as possible and while ensuring easy accessibility. \n Renewed \nawards of seals of quality for regulating homeowners™ insurance \nclaims reflect the positive feedback we have received from customers \nin this area.\nFinancial incentives for fair sales advice \n in the remuneration system\nTalanx™s group\n-wide Code of Conduct sets standards for responsible \nand ethical behaviour at all levels of the Group; see also the section of \nthat document entitled \n ﬁBeing fair in competitionﬂ\n. This means \nthat sales compliance is also covered by the Code, as well as being the \nsubject of extensive compliance training. \nIn order to ensure that intermediaries have the necessary qualifica\n-tions and expertise required for advising customers, domestic \nGroup companies have been active since 2013 (the year of its launch) \nin the ﬁGut beraten Œ Weiterbildung der Versicherungsvermittler in \nDeutschlandﬂ initiative, which was set up by the GDV and the associ\n-ations of intermediaries in the German insurance industry. Further\n-more, HDI provides ongoing support for the initiative by participat\n-ing actively in the relevant bodies. In addition to HDI Vertriebs AG, \nthe bancassurance companies neue leben insurers, TARGO insurers \nand PB insurers have joined the educational initiative in order to \n \nenhance their sales partners™ and employees™ qualifications trans\n-parently and for the long term. \nTalanx implemented the requirements of the Insurance Distribution \nDirective (IDD) and the associated delegated acts by the required \ndeadline. With regard to the issue of potentially inappropriate incen\n-tives, successive changes were already made to the remuneration \nrules, organisational processes and controls in previous years (and \nespecially when implementing the GDV Code of Conduct), so as to \navoid any such incentives being offered to intermediaries. Existing \nremuneration rules and competitive tenders were reviewed on an on\n-going basis and adapted where this was considered necessary to meet \nthe statutory requirements. The independence of insurance inter-\nmediaries is guaranteed. Clear rules apply to any additional remuner\n-ation that is granted and sample agreements are used.\nThe GDV Code of Conduct and the GDV™s interpretation of its princi\n-ples also offer a framework for dealing with conflicts of interests, \nwhile their implementation in the Retail Germany Division is leading \nto our own guidelines being drawn up. The Code™s application by the \ninsurance companies has been regularly monitored by HDI Germa\n-ny™s Compliance Management Steering Committee ever since the \nHDI companies were successfully certified as compliant for the first \ntime. The requirements of the IDD, including the related delegated \nacts and the various transpositions of the IDD into national law, were \nimplemented in full in 2018. The IDD requirements at the bancassur\n-ance companies also build on the measures already taken to imple\n-ment the GDV Code of Conduct and were implemented in line with \nthe statutory requirements. Consequently, the measures contained \nin the GDV Code of Conduct have been incorporated into standard \noperating practice at all companies that have signed up to the Code. \n\n70Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nESG in insurance solutions \n FS7 | FS8\n A large number of products from the Talanx Group™s \n \ninsurance companies support environmentally friendly products \nand technologies or take social interests into account. For example, \nthe services provided help ensure that environmental risks are suita\n-bly insured and that the impact of any damage can be remedied or \nmitigated. \nUnder the German Environmental Damage Act (USchadG), entities, \ntraders and self\n-employed professionals are liable for emissions and \nevents that result in damage to protected species and natural habi\n-tats (biodiversity), water and the soil. Commercial environmental in\n-surance covers such damage and enables it to be made good. In addi\n-tion, third\n-party liability insurance covers environmental damage in \nthose cases in which a party causes such damage to a third party. \nMoreover, the tariff structure used in motor insurance, for example, \nfavours low average annual mileage and hence promotes environ\n-mentally friendly driving behaviour. \nTalanx is working together with the PRIMAKLIMA association. HDI \ncustomers who take out motor vehicle insurance are given the op\n-portunity to offset their forecast carbon emissions using sustainable \nPRIMAKLIMA projects. This can be done by supporting reforestation \nprojects in Uganda, Bolivia and Germany, among other things. The \nvehicle model and number of kilometres involved are entered in an \nemissions calculator and the size of the donation is then determined. \nIn addition, customers can offset carbon emissions above and be\n-yond their own footprint. It should be noted that this opportunity \nexists even if no insurance is taken out. The entire amount of the do\n-nation is passed on to PRIMAKLIMA.\nHDI Lebensversicherung AG offers a quality\n-assured range of funds \nas part of its unit\n-linked annuity insurance. This selection also in\n-cludes 27 sustainably managed funds, including terrAssisi Aktien \nI˜AMI. This fund, which was launched by Group\n-owned fund manage\n-ment company Ampega Asset Management in cooperation with the \nFranciscans, invests solely in line with strict ethical criteria. HDI has \nalso created specific portfolios for customers, such as the ﬁInvest\n-ment\n-Stabilitäts\n-Paket Zukunft ESG (Kirchhoff)ﬂ and the ﬁInvest\n-ment\n-Stabilitäts\n-Paket Trend ESGﬂ. These two portfolios invest exclu\n-sively in companies and bonds whose sustainability is reviewed at \nregular intervals. See also the section entitled ﬁESG in asset manage\n-mentﬂ (\n  page 63 ff.). PB Lebensversicherung AG™s PB Zukunft Depot \nis a unit-linked annuity product that invests globally and in accord\n-ance with ESG criteria in a broadly diversified range of ETFs and \n \nselected active investment funds.\nThe various insurance areas within Industrial Lines also offer a wide \nrange of approaches that are relevant from a sustainability perspec\n-tive. For example, insurance against environmental damage is \n offered \nin the areas of motor and third\n-party liability insurance. \nAdditionally, in the motor vehicle area, some fleet business makes \nuse of telematics, which can reward environmentally friendly and \nsafe driving. We also offer driving training classes for customers. \nAbove and beyond the insurance business itself, safety engineers of\n-fer fleet consulting and risk management services that take sustaina\n-bility criteria into account. Last but not least, the line produces a \nnumber of publications for customers, e.g. on driving times and rests, \nhazardous goods transports and first aid at the scene of accidents.\nCustomers in the renewable energies, photovoltaics and solar cells \nareas are offered marine insurance. Our risk management staff also \nsupport them on how to secure loads, advise on packaging and assist \nin logistics planning. Among other things, this ﬁstart assistﬂ service \nfrom our risk management experts ensures that projects can qualify \nfor insurance in the first place. Another example of a service above \nand beyond the insurance business in the narrower sense of the word \nis the range of publications and information produced by the Marine \nline, such as information for drivers about freight thefts. The line \npartners with a number of organisations including customers and, \nmost recently, the Lower Saxony State Office of Criminal Investiga\n-tion (LKA) to prevent freight thefts, accidents and attacks, and to con\n-serve resources.\nProducts with environmental and social components are also offered \nin the field of third\n-party liability insurance. This includes insurance \ncover for hospitals, for major pharmaceutical risks and for partici\n-pants in clinical trials Œ something that contributes to ensuring pro\n-gress in research Œ plus cover for renewable energies.\nHDI Insurance takes sustainability into account in its household con\n-tents insurance. For example, it absorbs the additional cost of envi\n-ronmentally friendly household devices. In addition, special packag\n-es provide insurance cover for breakages of photovoltaic equipment \nand pedelecs with speeds of up to 25 km/h. We also take sustainability \naspects into account during loss adjustment in both the commercial \nand the retail insurance markets. For example, the additional cost of \nenvironmentally friendly measures is refunded for insured buildings \nfor which claims are being made due their destruction or damage, \nand building components are replaced. This covers environmentally \nfriendly measures such as the use of eco\n-friendly construction mate\n-rials, thermal insulation, switching to renewable or alternative ener\n-gy sources, and installing solar power plants, heat pumps or intelli\n-gent heating systems. The additional cost that would be incurred \ncompared to restoration without such environmentally friendly \nmeasures is refunded. Furthermore, insurance covers the cost of re\n-moving (to the extent that no natural regeneration is to be expected) \nor restoring (to the extent that natural regeneration is to be expect\n-ed) trees on insured properties that have been uprooted by storms. In \nthe case of an insured event, the insurer will also refund the cost of \nrecultivating gardens relating to trees, shrubs, plants, plant supports \nand climbing plants with young shoots.\nEngineering Insurance offers a wide range of insurance solutions that \npromote renewable energy, from onshore and offshore wind power \nprojects through photovoltaics down to geothermal energy. The In\n-dustrial Lines Division can also provide cover for prototype develop\n-ment, such as in the case of tidal power plants. Insurance cover starts \nwith construction and extends for many years of operation at the \ncustomer. In this way, Talanx Group companies such as HDI Global SE \nprovide support for technologies that reduce carbon emissions and \nfor the transition to green energy in Germany.\n\n71Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nIn the field of wind power, we offer cover for the construction and \noperation of onshore and offshore projects. Cover already exists for \noffshore wind farms in Europe, while in the rest of the world the focus \non these risks is increasing. Engineering Insurance has created a ded\n-icated centre of competence to provide end\n-to\n-end customer support \nand offer optimal solutions. Cover has been written for the construc\n-tion and operation of onshore projects around the world. As regards \nphotovoltaics, the Industrial Lines Division supports systems rang\n-ing from just a few megawatts to large plants in the gigawatt category. \nIn this context, Industrial Lines does not restrict itself to convention\n-al photovoltaic modules that convert solar energy directly into green \npower, but also offers insurance cover for new ways of generating \npower from solar energy, such as parabolic trough power plants. In \naddition, HDI Global SE supports customers by performing risk in\n-spections during the construction and operation phases for all of the \nabove\n-mentioned types of power plant, in order to make their opera\n-tion as smooth as possible. HDI Global SE worked together with the \nGDV and other insurance companies and partners to develop the \nﬁOffshore Code of Practiceﬂ (OCoP) Œ a set of international guidelines \nfor offshore wind farm risk management.\nGroup accident insurance has expanded its focus to include travel \nsafety, relieving customers of significant parts of their duties of care \nas employers in this area. An AI\n-based solution combines preventive, \nalert and crisis intervention services, minimising the many different \nhealth and security risks facing employees during business trips. \nTalanx has decided to use this solution for its own staff as well.\nHDI Global SE is also the first industrial insurer in Germany to have \noffered the option of comprehensive insurance cover for weather \nrisks and their potential consequences, and hence to offset financial \nlosses resulting from insured weather events. Its ﬁKLIMArisk Œ the \nweather risk insuranceﬂ product is offered to enterprises from all \nsectors.\nNo information is currently available on the monetary value of prod\n-ucts and services that were developed by the Talanx Group to deliver \na specific environmental or social benefit. \nThe Talanx Group™s Code of Conduct covers compliance with human \nrights at industrial policyholders (\n  page 105 f.). Legally correct, \n \nresponsible behaviour is critical for our business success. This also \napplies to our relationships with business partners, customers and \nthe general public. \nWe do not capture data on supporting a healthy lifestyle, since the \nTalanx Group is only active in the field of e.g. health insurance to a \nvery limited extent.\n FS13\n One of the ways in which the Talanx Group offers access to \nthe insurance market for all sections of the population, especially in \nsparsely populated and economically disadvantaged areas, is by \n \nensuring comprehensive insurance provision via different sales \nchannels. In the case of the Retail Germany Division and the bancas\n-surance companies, the insurance companies also use remote cus\n-tomer advisory and online sales offerings. The apps that customers \ncan use to encrypt documents to be sent to the bancassurance com\n-panies, which were introduced a number of years ago, were upgraded \nand distributed more broadly. This permits both more efficient han\n-dling of customer concerns and more rapid processing. In addition, \nindividual bancassurance companies offer their customers a digital \nsignature option that enables less resource\n-intensive and significant\n-ly shorter contract processing.\nSecondly, for example, the Industrial Lines Division not only provides \ncover and advice on constructing and operating different types of \npower plants in developed markets in Europe, North America and \nparts of Asia, but also promotes climate\n-friendly energy develop\n-ment in South America, Africa and other emerging markets and \n \ndeveloping countries. In addition, the Hannover Re Group offers \n \nmicroinsurance and agricultural insurance designed to mitigate the \nfinancial impact of climate\n-related crop damage.\nApart from ensuring uniform coverage of the areas in which the \nGroup companies covered by this report offer their services, the com\n-panies provide (potential) customers with access to their products via \nthe website, mobile apps and intermediaries who also visit customers \nat home. The WARTA Group also offers national call centres where \ncustomers can obtain the full range of information about products \nand services, plus mobile experts who can assess losses on the \nground. \n\n72Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nPrinciples for Sustainable Insurance\nThe Talanx Group signed up to the Principles for Sustainable Insur\n-ance (PSI) in May 2020 and by doing so has committed voluntarily to \ncontinuously improving the sustainability of its insurance business \nin line with the initiative™s four principles.

Underwriting plays a key role here. This area and the related \ndecision\n-making processes are described in detail in the chapter enti\n-tled ﬁSustainability of insurance productsﬂ. \n SRˆ20ˆŒˆpageˆ66\nPrinciple 2:\n We will work together with our clients and business part\n-ners to raise awareness of environmental, social and governance \n \nissues, manage risk and develop solutions.\nWe also set long\n-term incentives in our work together with our busi\n-ness partners. For example, we require them to take fundamental \nESG requirements into account and manage them responsibly. We \nhave developed a Code of Conduct for Business Partners that sets \nstandards in the areas of anti\n-corruption and bribery matters, respect \nfor human rights, environmental, social and other employee matters, \ndata protection and the protection of trade secrets. \n SRˆ20ˆŒˆpageˆ105\nPrinciple 3:\n We will work together with governments, regulators and \nother key stakeholders to promote widespread action across society \non environmental, social and governance issues. \nWe are in regular discussion with selected non\n-governmental organi\n-sations so as to continuously raise our awareness for particularly \n \nsensitive ESG topics. We use the suggestions made by the auditors \nduring the review of our consolidated non\n-financial statement to im\n-prove further. \nIn addition, we use our position as Germany™s third\n-largest insurer to \nraise awareness of sustainability issues within the insurance indus\n-try, e.g. by contributing our expertise to the Gesamtverband der \nDeutschen Versicherungswirtschaft e.\n V. (GDV). Dealing with the chal\n-lenges posed by sustainability is one of our priorities here. We are \nalso active members of additional initiatives and networks, and \nadopt open, transparent positions in discussions with politicians. \n SRˆ20ˆŒˆpageˆ26\nWe use our regularly updated stakeholder survey and materiality \nanalysis to engage in active dialogue with our key stakeholders.\nPrinciple 4:\n We will demonstrate accountability and transparency in \nregularly disclosing publicly our progress in implementing the \n Principles. \n SRˆ20ˆŒˆpageˆ5\nThis initial progress report creates additional transparency with \n \nrespect to the Talanx Group™s sustainability management.

HDI Sigorta in Turkey has been committed to this \nprinciple right from the start and is working towards creating a work\n-ing environment in which no employees experience any discrimina\n-tion on the basis of their gender. This was confirmed in 2020, when \nthe company was awarded the Equality for Women at Work Certifi\n-cate for the first time.\nHDI Sigorta has started implementing an equal opportunities\n-based \napproach both in the company itself and in its activities as a corpo\n-rate citizen. This is because we believe that equality in the workplace \nis important for our country and our economy. The current situation \nin Turkey shows that only three out of ten women who could work \nactually have a job. In fact, the number of unemployed women has \nrisen by 52 percent in the past five years.\nHDI Sigorta is promoting equal opportunities in the workplace \nthrough guidelines for gender equality, mechanisms for reporting \ncases of discrimination and equal pay for male and female employ\n-ees, plus projects designed to support women in society. Today, the \ncompany employs almost as many women as men. This balanced \nmix also extends to management and clearly shows HDI Sigorta™s \naim of recruiting people on the basis of their qualifications and not \ntheir gender.\n\n76Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nTeamwork\nHDI Sigorta manager Nesrin Tuncer Türkgür is a good example of \nequality in the workplace. She has more than 25 years of experience \nin the insurance sector. As Head of Claims Audits &amp; Logistics at HDI \nSigorta she leads a team of 33 people, including four women. \nThe unit focuses on ensuring proper claims handling Œ without \n \nimpacting customer satisfaction Œ and on reviewing our processes to \nimprove efficiency. In other words, the department is an area in \nwhich professional knowledge, a detailed analytical approach, pro\n-cess and efficiency considerations, and service quality are required. \nBy contrast, the Contact Centre is concerned with customer satisfac\n-tion: it has to understand customer needs correctly and handle \n \nrequests and complaints correctly.\nNesrin Tuncer Türkgür™s team supports customers with all claims, \nsuch as those resulting from traffic accidents. HDI Sigorta offers cus\n-tomers a special service for this: they can drive their vehicle to the \ncompany™s location in Istanbul and have the damage assessed there, \nsafe in the knowledge that their case will be dealt with in the best \npossible way. After this, Nesrin Tuncer Türkgür™s team processes the \nclaim. Where necessary, she discusses difficult cases with the team \nand with Nihal Asker, Assistant General Manager, Claims &amp; Opera\n-tions, who is responsible not only for the Claims unit but also for the \nCustomer Relations and Legal departments. ﬁI believe that we can \nonly handle claims for our customers by taking a teams\n-based \n \napproach and by leveraging all the knowledge we have about our \n \nclients.

A total of 10.9% \n(11.1%) of all employees work part\n-time.In the Retail Germany Division, insurance is sold via insurance bro\n-kers, bank sales partners and cooperative arrangements with other \nbusinesses, as well as by tied agents (employees) and by self\n- employed \ncommercial agents working exclusively for HDI. All in all, 355 (362) \ncommercial agents worked for HDI™s tied agent operations at the \n2020 year\n-end. In addition, the Talanx Group had a total of 193 (386) \ncontract workers in Germany. This figure corresponds to less than 2% \n(4%) of the total number of staff employed in the country.\nThe following sections in this chapter contain detailed information \non the Talanx Group™s workforce in Germany (not including the \n \nHannover Re Group).\n 102-8\n There are no significant variations in the number of em\n-ployees (e.g. for seasonal reasons) in the Talanx Group. Employee \ndata are captured centrally and locally using a number of different \nsoftware systems such as SAP and Tagetik.\n 102-41\n Joint decisions\n-making by employees is ensured via the \nemployee representatives on the Supervisory Board and by co\n-deter\n-mination within the enterprise. This takes place at three different lev\n-els within the Talanx Group, with a relevant body for each: the local \nworks councils at the establishment level, the Company Works Coun\n-cil at Company level and the Group Works Council at Group level. \nEach level also represents the interests of our vocational trainees and \ndisabled employees.\nA total of 91.3% (92.1%) of Talanx Group\'s employees in Germany (ex\n-cluding the Hannover Re Group) are covered by collective bargaining \nagreements, i.e. the companies are members of the Employers™ Feder\n-ation or apply the national general collective agreement for the pri\n-vate insurance industry. The remuneration paid to the remaining \nemployees is not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The \nlarge majority of these are people who perform special duties or have \nresponsibility for areas for which the requirements are higher than \nthose set out for the highest remuneration group under the collec\n-tive bargaining agreement.\nEmployee recruitment and development\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n Competent, committed and entrepreneurial \nstaff are a critical success factor for the Talanx Group. This means that \nrecruitment, education and training are material topics for us. Our \nemployees use their many and varied talents at our different Group \ncompanies to drive forward our business success and promote cus\n-tomer satisfaction. Our professional programmes facilitate employee \ndevelopment and help staff continuously enhance their skills. These \nofferings also take developments such as demographic change, the \ndecline in the size of the working population and changes in the \nworld of work into account. The Talanx Group uses a variety of strate\n-gic approaches to ensure it always has adequate numbers of talented \nyoung staff. These include dual\n-track vocational training and degree \ncourses, plus induction, graduate trainee and talent development \nprogrammes.\nTopic Boundary and impacts:\n Human Resources is the main func\n-tion within the Talanx Group responsible for employee topics, \n \nalthough these also affect individual employees and hence the Group \nas a whole. Externally, personnel marketing is one of the key tools \nused to underpin the Group™s image as an attractive employer for \n \n(potential) applicants. In addition, impacts arise at all places in the \nvalue chain in which employees come into contact with customers, \nsince well\n-qualified customer support staff ensure the quality of our \nservices. Sound education and training are therefore a prerequisite \nfor our business success and competitive position.\n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n Our human resources work aims \nto ensure our Company™s sustainable, profitable growth. We achieve \nthis by having the right people in the right place and assigning them \nthe right tasks. Value\n-based management and a culture of coopera\n-tion are at the heart of everything we do. An effective, efficient \n \nhuman \nresources process is needed in order to remain competitive in the \nlong term and to attract and retain qualified employees. It also \n \nensures that the Talanx Group is well positioned to meet the chal\n-lenges posed by demographic change. Human resources support, \nhuman resources marketing, initial professional training and \n \nemployee development are key components of our Group\n-wide \n \nhuman resources work.\n 201-3\n A transparent management style aims at promoting a \nrisk-conscious, high\n-performance culture among our employees. Our \nmanagement tools and flat hierarchies are based on a high degree of \nindividual personal responsibility. In addition, the Talanx Group of\n-fers performance\n-related pay, flexible working hours where the job \npermits and attractive social benefits. The latter include occupational \nretirement provision, capital accumulation benefits, and holiday and \nChristmas bonuses. Group companies have generally made defined \ncontribution or defined benefit pension commitments to their \n \nemployees. Measured in terms of the sums involved, the majority of \npension commitments are based on defined benefit plans. Additional \ninformation on the Talanx Group™s pensions and other post\n-retire\n-ment benefits can be found in the Annual Report 2020 (see the sec\n-tion entitled ﬁProvisions for Pensions and other Post\n-Employment \nBenefitsﬂ on page 206ff.). All these benefits are reflected in our moder\n-ate staff turnover rate and employees™ long periods of service with the \nGroup, see also the section entitled ﬁRecruiting and attracting talentﬂ \n(  page 81 f.). \nInitial vocational training is a key element in attracting and retaining \ntalented young staff in Germany. This can be seen from the consist\n-ently high proportion of vocational trainees who are taken on perma\n-nently after completing their courses, which has been in the range of \n80% to 90% for years. Different companies within the Talanx Group \noffer a wide range of training options, from classic vocational training \nthrough to bachelor™s degrees.\nA broad range of internal training opportunities ensures our employ\n-ees have the skills they need to perform their current and future tasks. \nWe are increasingly deploying new learning formats here, which per\n-mit both digital learning and collaborative learning based on targeted \nnetworking within the Group. In addition, our financial support for \nin-service vocational training and degree programmes promotes \n \nemployability in general.\n\n81Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nIdentifying and developing our next generation of managers and spe\n-cialists is another focus of our human resources development work. \nIndividual development and induction programmes are used to pre\n-pare and qualify potential candidates for their future work. As a result, \nmanagement and specialist positions can largely be filled from within \nthe Group™s own ranks, assuming candidates are equally qualified; see \nalso the section entitled ﬁRecruiting and attracting talentﬂ. This hu\n-man resources policy offers career\n-driven high performers especially \nattractive prospects. The development programme for young profes\n-sionals that we launched in 2018 aims to ensure that the best voca\n-tional trainees and dual\n-track degree students stay with the Group. In \naddition, we offer ongoing qualification measures designed to devel\n-op employees™ professional and methodological expertise, and to en\n-hance their personal skills. We established our Agility Campus in 2018 \nto support our transformation into an agile organisation. This offer\n-ing, which is aimed at both managers and other employees, compris\n-es a number of different modules, teaches participants about agile \nmethods and helps promote an agile mindset. In 2020, our almost \nentirely digital continuing education offering focused among other \nthings on building digital skills, working together as a team in virtual \nenvironments, and expanding leadership skills to include remote \nleadership. Employee reviews, feedback instruments and personal \nstocktaking exercises can also be used to enable staff to reflect on their \nown behaviour and adapt to changed requirements.\nThe Talanx Corporate Academy is a core tool for strategy implementa\n-tion and cultural development within the Group. The programme \nteaches strategy issues to top managers from all divisions. The focus \nin 2020 was on leadership and digital transformation.\nThe Talanx Group™s strategic decision to focus its university marketing \non six selected universities and institutions of higher education is de\n-signed to attract suitable graduate recruits for the Group. \nIn April 2016, the Talanx Group joined the\n  Fair Company Initiative\n, Germany™s largest employer initiative for students and young profes\n-sionals. Around 600 companies in Germany have signed up to the \ninitiative, which was launched by karriere.de Œ a portal run by the \nﬁHandelsblattﬂ daily newspaper and ﬁWirtschaftsWocheﬂ magazine. It \naims to promote reliable, recognised quality standards and transpar\n-ent rules for interns. By joining, the Talanx Group has underscored its \nexisting long\n-term commitment to the responsible, forward\n-looking \norganisation of student placements.\nThe Talanx Group has also set itself the goal of continuously reviewing \nits rules and guidelines in the area of work and employees. One of the \naims here is to analyse whether it would make sense to expand them \nto include sustainability criteria and, if so, how to do this.\nResponsibilities:\n We need effective, efficient human resources pro\n-cesses and services if we are to compete for the next generation of top \ntalent and to meet the challenges posed by demographic change. Hu\n-man resources support, human resources marketing, initial profes\n-sional training and employee development are key components of \nour Group\n-wide human resources work. The member of HDI Service \nAG™s Board of Management responsible for Human Resources has \nbeen assigned responsibility for Group\n-wide human resources activi\n-ties; these include implementing and enhancing our human resourc\n-es strategy, planning and managing the various human resources \nfunctions™ strategic goals and operational activities, and managing \nstakeholders and their needs. The Talanx Group™s Labour Relations \nDirector is responsible for human resources at the level of the Talanx \nGroup™s Board of Management; this role is performed by the Chair\n-man of the Board of Management.\nThe various units within the Human Resources department are re\n-sponsible for initiating the Group™s human resources policy and the \nconcepts behind its strategy in this area, and for developing and im\n-plementing leading\n-edge human resources activities. In addition, the \ndepartment has specialists in the areas of human resources manage\n-ment (including support and human resources marketing), employ\n-ment law, remuneration management, occupational pensions, hu\n-man resources administration (including payroll administration and \nhuman resources controlling) and human resources development \n(including education and training, talent development, management \ndevelopment and change management).\nOther key tasks include ensuring at a strategic level that the Company \nrecruits and retains talented young staff by offering dual\n-track voca\n-tional training and degree programmes, and induction, graduate \ntrainee and talent development programmes. The department™s re\n-sponsibility generally covers the Group companies in Germany with \nthe exception of the Hannover Re Group; in the case of some topics \n(e.g. international programmes such as the Management Develop\n-ment Programme or the Talanx Corporate Academy) it also extends to \nour foreign companies. \nThe Talanx Group™s activities in the area of education and training also \nextend above and beyond its own employees (see the section entitled \nﬁCorporate Citizenshipﬂ(\n  page 88). 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring: \nHuman resources con\n-trolling is responsible for planning, managing and monitoring hu\n-man resources activities and processes within the Talanx Group.

This figure covers both classroom and \nweb\n-based training. In 2020, many courses were held as web\n-based \ncourses because of the pandemic. In addition, well in excess of 10,000 \npurely online courses were held using LearningSpace, our internal \nlearning management system. The CPD offered is aimed at all Talanx \nGroup employees in Germany (with the exception of the Hannover \nRe Group) regardless of their position in the corporate hierarchy; \nsome programmes are specifically designed for the bancassurance \nand sales companies.

Where \nappropriate, these programmes can also be tailored to specific em\n-ployees groups in order to maximise their effect. Measures include \nseminars, training courses and individual coaching offerings that are \ndeveloped on the basis of regular employee reviews. In some cases \nwhere employees are made redundant or terminated, outplacement \nprogrammes designed to ensure a smooth transition are offered. \n \nEmployees approaching retirement are able to opt for partial retire\n-ment for a certain transitional phase. This means that the employer \ncan reduce the number of hours they work.\n 404-3\n The different companies have different tools and processes \nthat managers use to hold regular feedback discussions with their \nstaff, due to different works agreements. With effect from the start of \n2020, ﬁLet´s Talkﬂ offers a uniform employee review procedure for the \nwhole of Germany, which helps create successful cooperation and \ntrusting communication between managers and staff. Talanx™s sen\n-ior executives Œ generally first\n- and second\n-tier managers Œ have an\n-nual reviews with their superiors as part of their goal\n-setting process.\nTalanx as an employer\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n Numerous examples can be given of develop\n-ments that are changing the nature of work within the Group. These \ninclude a rising number of older members of the workforce, the \nyounger generations (generations Y and Z), the need for greater mo\n-bility and an improved work\n-family balance, increasing globalisation \nand an associated rise in the proportion of people in our society who \ncome from migrant backgrounds. \nOur proactive diversity management policy, our offerings for achiev\n-ing a better work\n-family balance, and the remuneration and other \ncompany benefits that we provide aim not only to create a respectful, \nopen and inclusive working atmosphere in which people with a wide \nrange of individual skills collaborate readily, but also to actively and \nconsciously use and promote diversity in order to maintain and in\n-crease our Company™s success and competitiveness. Respecting and \nobserving human rights and ensuring equal opportunities are part of \nhow we define ourselves as a company. \nTopic Boundary: \nThe topic of Talanx as an employer, with all its \nmany different aspects, is relevant for the entire Talanx Group down \nto individual employees. Outside the Group it is relevant to the sup\n-ply chain/value chain, e.g. it is important for (potential) job appli\n-cants, but also for customers and business partners with whom our \nemployees are in, or make, contact.\nImpacts:\n Employee diversity is part of our DNA. We cultivate a corpo\n-rate culture of respect, appreciation and mutual acceptance. Talanx \nemploys women and men from an extremely wide range of national, \nethnic, religious and personal backgrounds and of different ages, as \nwell as people with and without disabilities and with different sexual \norientations. It is precisely this diversity that makes our heterogene\n-ous Group successful. We therefore define diversity management as \nconsciously promoting variety among the workforce and ensuring \nequal opportunities so that all employees can deploy their skills and \ntalents as optimally as possible. At the same time, our actions can \ncontribute to promoting acceptance and openness within society \nand hence make a positive contribution above and beyond a basic \nrespect for human rights. The Talanx Group is keen to ensure a suc\n-cessful work\n-life balance and supports this by offering flexible work\n-ing time models, opportunities for part\n-time work and a deferred \ncompensation scheme. Remote working schemes enable employees \nto manage their daily work more flexibly and hence, for example, to \nimprove their work\n-family balance. Our additional benefits and con\n-\n84Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\ncrete offerings designed to improve our employees™ work\n-family bal\n-ance support our staff, contributing both to their basic security and \nto their general satisfaction. \n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines: \nThe Group has already taken a \nnumber of measures to promote diversity, prevent discrimination \nand support our employees in their development regardless of their \norigins. In addition, a number of internal rules and regulations aim to \nensure and monitor compliance with human rights. A number of \nworks agreements on human resources topics also exist. The decision \nby the Talanx Board of Management in September 2020 to make a \nBoard of Management member responsible for diversity also under\n-scores the importance that promoting this topic within the Company \nhas for the Talanx Group. The goal is to develop a Group\n-wide diversi\n-ty strategy.\nIn its  ﬁDiversity Commitmentﬂ\n, the Group™s Board of Management \nhas undertaken to acknowledge, value and incorporate diversity in \nTalanx™s corporate culture. In addition, in 2013 the Board of Manage\n-ment signed the \n Diversity Charter\n, a corporate initiative designed \nto promote diversity at companies and institutions. The Diversity \nCharter is a binding foundation for our activities. The Board of Man\n-agement also takes diversity into consideration when making \n \nappointments to management positions, in line with the Company™s \nCorporate Governance Principles.\nOne example of how we promote diversity is our cross\n-generational \nmentoring programme for young professionals, which teams up \nyoung staff on dual\n-track degree programmes with experienced \nmanagers who act as mentors, encouraging their mentees™ develop\n-ment and sharing their knowledge and experience with them. Job \nrotation helps further promote a culturally and ethnically interna\n-tional Group.\nTalanx employs people with international roots and different \n cultural \nbackgrounds. The Group is participating in the \n Project \n ﬁAdelanteﬂ\n, which enables EU citizens to receive vocational training at companies \nin Germany.\nDiversity and equal opportunity\nThe Talanx Group is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for \nmen and women and intends to further increase the proportion of \nwomen in management positions in the long term. The German Act \non the Equal Participation of Men and Women in Management Posi\n-tions in the Private and Public Sectors (FüPoG) requires listed compa\n-nies and companies that are covered by co\n-determination require\n-ments to set targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory \nboards and boards of management/among their managing directors, \nplus the two tiers of management below this, and to report on wheth\n-er these targets have been met.\nIn line with the statutory requirements, Talanx AG™s Supervisory \nBoard has to comprise at least 30% women; this figure applies to any \nelections and new appointments to fill one or more seats on the \n \nSupervisory Board that become necessary as from 1 January 2016. The \nSupervisory Board comprises more than 30% women both when \n taken \nas a whole and when broken down by employee and shareholder \n representatives. \nThe Supervisory Board has announced that it will seek to appoint at \nleast one woman to the Board of Management in the period from \n1˜July 2017 to 30 June 2022. A target of 20% women was defined for the \ntier 1 management level and one of 30% for tier 2 management; see \n page 84 ff.  In order to achieve this goal, it is important for our human resources \ndevelopment function to actively and systematically advance our fe\n-male employees. One of the diversity management measures we offer \nis a women™s mentoring programme that aims to help high\n-potential \nfemale employees to grow into more senior management positions. \nThe mentors, all of whom are members of boards of management or \nsenior executives, support their mentees for a year. In addition, our \nCompany has dedicated development programmes for management \nand specialist functions and project managers that are open to both \nwomen and men. Managers at Talanx are regularly made aware of the \nneed to encourage and develop female employees with potential, so \nas to increase the proportion of women in management positions in \nthe long term. Additionally, a women™s network, Women@Talanx, \npromotes informal contacts among female specialists and managers \nat all levels of the corporate hierarchy. Talanx™s women™s network has \nindependently set itself the goal of giving our Group™s female employ\n-ees a platform for networking so that they can learn from and with \neach other. The women™s network is sponsored by Torsten Leue, the \nChairman of Talanx AG™s Board of Management.\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n Proactive diversity manage\n-ment is an integral part of the planning, management and monitor\n-ing of human resources activities and processes within the Talanx \nGroup and as such is part of human resources controlling; see also \nthe section entitled ﬁRecruiting and attracting talentﬂ (\n  page 81 f.). In addition, Talanx™s Operational Auditing Competence Centre \n \nregularly performs human resources risk and process audits in \n \naccordance with the principles set out by the Institute of Internal \nAuditors (IIA).\nThe decision by the Talanx Board of Management in September 2020 \nto make a Board of Management member responsible for diversity \nunderscores the importance that promoting this topic within the \nCompany has for the Talanx Group. Talanx has resolved to appoint a \nDiversity &amp; Inclusion Manager as of March 2021. Talanx decides to \nappoint a Diversity &amp; Inclusion Manager as of March 2021; her task \nwill be to develop a Group\n-wide diversity strategy.\n 405-2\n For Talanx, diversity management also means reaching as \nmany potential job applicants as possible. This is why salaries are \npaid exclusively on the basis of the job concerned, taking employees™ \nqualifications and performance into account. Position grading at \nspecialist and management level is also based exclusively on the \ntasks and responsibilities associated with the post. By contrast, gen\n-der does not play a role in our remuneration policy. Two people doing \nthe same job and with the same or similar experience and skills will \nnot be offered different salaries because they have different genders.\n\n85Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\n 406-1\n Talanx does not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race, \ncolour, gender, age, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity or gender expression, relationship status, nationality, disa\n-bility, medical conditions, or any other legally protected factor.

Our divisions offer \nemployees a wide variety of options for professional and personal de\n-velopment during all phases of their lives. We create an attractive, \nfamily\n-friendly working environment and working conditions in \nwhich both men and women can combine a job and a family as a mat\n-ter of course. This is why we offer our employees flexible working \ntime models and the ability to work part\n-time. Additionally, remote \nworking enables employees to manage their daily work flexibly, in \nline with their individual requirements.\nMany Talanx employees with children are facing childcare bottle\n-necks during the coronavirus pandemic. If personal flexitime credits \nand vacation entitlements are not enough to ensure that they cannot \ncare for their children for at home without taking a cut in salary, em\n-ployees may be able to benefit from ﬁflexitime credit donationsﬂ. \nThere is a high level of solidarity among Talanx™s employees, coupled \nwith the wish to donate overtime credits from their own flexitime \nbalances. Talanx has created a framework for this solidarity among \nstaff belonging to Talanx™s Primary Insurance Group in Germany by \nenabling ﬁflexitime credit donationsﬂ. All in all, 430 donors gifted \nroughly 12,576 hours in the period up to the end of December 2020 Œ \nin line with our Talanx Purpose: ﬁTogether we take care of the unex\n-pected and foster entrepreneurshipﬂ.\nOur family service supports parents by helping them to find suitable \nchildcare. Another way in which we support parents of pre\n-school age \nchildren is by paying a tax\n-free monthly contribution towards their \nchildcare costs. Since 1 January 2014, this allowance has been granted \nfor one year to employees who resume working for a Talanx Group \ncompany in Germany (not including the Hannover Re Group) after \nthe end of their parental leave. Since we recognise that the ability to \ncombine a career and a family is important for our employees, we not \nonly offer extremely flexible part\n-time working options but also \n \nallow staff to work from home during their parental leave period. As \npart of our efforts to improve our employees™ work\n-family balance, a \nnumber of locations have set up parent\n-and-child offices. These offer \nemergency support to parents with short\n-term childcare problems \n(which can arise, for example, if their child minder is suddenly taken \nill or lessons at school are cancelled at short notice). In this way, par\n-ents can look after children up to the age of 12 and work at the same \ntime. In addition, the Talanx Group provides a fixed number of nurs\n-ery care places in Hannover. A dedicated day care centre is being \nplanned for Hannover and is scheduled to open in 2021.\nOur employees have access to a comprehensive range of preventive \nmeasures as part of the Company™s holistic health management pro\n-gramme, allowing them to strengthen their personal capabilities. \nHealth days are held regularly at all German locations, and in 2020 an \noverarching digital HDI Health Week was held for the first time. In \naddition, employees have access to external counselling and a family \nservice in the case of personal, professional, or psychological issues.\nTo understand how employees view the Group™s culture and organi\n-sation, Talanx™s Board of Management invites all employees world\n-wide to take part in an ﬁOrganisational Health Checkﬂ (OHC) survey \nevery year. Talanx™s OHC consists of roughly 30 questions and was \nperformed for the second time in 2020.\nEmployees are also granted other company benefits such as special \nleave in certain circumstances, subsidised lunches and the subsi\n-dised use of public transport; see also the section entitled ﬁRemuner\n-ation and benefitsﬂ (\n  page 88). 401-3\n In Germany, a collective agreement specifies that additional \nparental leave of up to six months can be taken immediately after the \nstatutory parental leave period in certain circumstances, in order to \nensure continued childcare. Parental leave under the collective \n \nagreement for the private insurance industry ends at the latest three\n-and-a-half years after a child is born.\n\n87Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nRETURN FROM PARENTAL LEAVE (GERMANY) \nNumberGERMANY\n92.9% (95.3%)MALE \n97.4% (97.9%)FEMALE \n90.3% (93.9%)350300250200150100 50196(192)191(188)340(343)307(322)2020/2019 On parental leave in previous period.\n  Returned to work in the reporting period or planning to return in the following year.\nRETENTION RATES AFTER PARENTAL LEAVE (GERMANY)\n NumberGERMANY\n94.4% (91.1%)MALE \n93.2% (˙ˆ.ˆ%) FEMALE \n96.1% (ˆˇ.˙%) 250200150100 50164(151)123(116)2020/2019 Retention rates after parental leave.\n RETURN FROM PARENTAL LEAVE (REST OF WORLD)\n ˜NumberAUSLAND\n69.2% (69.7%)MALE \n88.4% (90.5%)FEMALE \n65.0% (65.7%)350300250200150100 5069(63)61(57)317(327)206(215)2020/2019 On parental leave in previous period.\n  Returned to work in the reporting period or planning to return in the following year.\n1  \n2020: No data available for Switzerland.\nRETENTION RATES AFTER PARENTAL LEAVE (REST OF WORLD)\n ˜NumberAUSLAND\n68.8% (67.4%)MALE\n87.5% FEMALE \n63.7% (62.0%) 300 250200150100 5056(56)151(147)2020/2019 Retention rates after parental leave.\n 1   \n2020: No data available for Great Britain, Switzerland and Hungary.\n\n88Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nCorporate citizenship\nTalanx is aware of the social responsibility that comes from being a \nlisted company that employs people around the world. As a responsi\n-ble corporate citizen, the Group works to advance social matters, and \npromotes charitable projects and local initiatives. In this way, we \n \nsupport society above and beyond our actual business activities.\nThe Talanx Group is particularly active in the area of education and \ntraining. The core measure used here is the HDI Foundation™s award of \nup to 15 scholarships per semester to talented students throughout \nGermany. The support provided covers selected insurance\n-related dis\n-ciplines at the University of Braunschweig, Göttingen University, the \nUniversity of Hamburg, Leibniz University in Hannover, the Universi\n-ty of Leipzig, the University of Cologne, Cologne University of Applied \nSciences, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the University of \nUlm. The total support package is worth around EUR 200,000 per \nyear.\nIn addition, our ﬁDeutschlandstipendiumﬂ scholarships provide sup\n-port for students at universities in Hannover; these take the form of a \nmix of financial assistance and events and workshops held at the \nCompany. The topics covered range from specialist lectures to train\n-ing courses in key skills.\nThe Talanx Group is one of the sponsors of Germany™s National Math\n-ematics Competition. In addition to providing financial support, we \nwork together with the organisers to offer online seminars on subjects \nrelating to mathematics, such as actuarial science. The National Math\n-ematics Competition is designed for school students of all classes who \nare interested in mathematics, both in German schools and abroad. \nBy acting as a sponsor, the Group aims to stimulate interest in the \nsubject among school students and to encourage and support talent\n-ed young mathematicians. Insurance companies need mathemati\n-cians to calculate risks, premiums and technical provisions, among \nother things.Another example of our social commitment is our support in Cologne \nfor the ﬁhimmel &amp; ääd e.\n V.ﬂ association. Donations collected during \nChristmas campaigns and other events benefit children and young \npeople in the city. ﬁhimmel &amp; ääd e.\n V.ﬂ organises daily lunches, home\n-work and afternoon clubs, and leisure and vacation activities up to \nand including careers advice.\nGroup companies abroad are also involved in local social projects. For \nexample, HDI Global SE in the Netherlands supports the Dirk Kuyt \nFoundation, which organises and assists with sports events for the dis\n-abled in the country. Our Mexican subsidiary HDI Seguros S.\n A. de C.\n V. \nworks together with CEMEFI, a philanthropic organisation that aims \nto achieve a fair, supportive and economically developed society in \nMexico. In the USA, HDI USA™s Community Service Committee aims to \nidentify charitable organisations to give back to those in need. For ex\n-ample, staff in Chicago support the local community by volunteering \ntheir free time at, or making donations to, organisations assisting \n \ncancer patients or homeless shelters, among other causes. \nThe Talanx Group also launched a large number of initiatives around \nthe world to help people during this difficult coronavirus period. Our \ninvolvement takes many forms and is always tailored to local needs. \nAnd it is very different depending on whether it focuses on our \n \ncustomers, our employees or on social initiatives.\n  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.talanx.com/nRemuneration">www.talanx.com\nRemuneration</a> and benefits\nThe Talanx Group™s remuneration system comprises a performance\n- driven and responsibility\n-based salary along with results\n- based pay\n-ments and the attractive social benefits mentioned here. Salary ad\n-justments based on internal and external remuneration analyses \nensure that Group pay is competitive. Paying adequate salaries and \ninforming our staff transparently about the individual components \nof their overall remuneration are key human resources goals. At \nTalanx, individual salaries depend on the function performed and \nthe employee™s personal professional qualifications and perfor\n-mance. In addition to assigning positions to the salary bands set out \nin the collective agreement for the insurance industry, this is based \non a uniform, non\n-employee\n-specific evaluation of all management \npositions throughout the Group that is performed using the stand\n-ardised Hay method. This framework enables the Group to \n ensure \nthat its salary structure is not only performance\n-driven and responsi\n-bility-based, but also market\n-competitive.\n 401-2\n A large number of voluntary company benefits are also \navailable in principle to all employees. In Germany, these comprise: \n Capital accumulation benefit \n Health management \n Special leave for specific events \n Childcare contribution \n Marriage and childbirth allowances \n Subsidised lunches \n Subsidised use of public transport \n Subsidised participation in external sports events \n Group accident insurance \nEqually, there is no distinction in terms of voluntary benefits at our \nforeign subsidiaries between full\n-time and part\n-time employees. \nHowever, some benefits such as preventive healthcare measures and \noccupational retirement provision are reserved for employees with \npermanent contracts.\nIn response to an initiative by the Group Works Council, the Talanx \nGroup entered into discussions with it that led to the formation of \nthe TAUVE e.\n V. (Talanx Unterstützungsverein) benevolent fund. \n \nEmployees who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in \n \nsevere economic or personal difficulties can obtain financial assis\n-tance from the company. The one\n-time grants of up to EUR 5,000 do \nnot have to be repaid.\n\n89Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nOccupational health and safety\n 103-1 | 403-3\n Materiality and impacts:\n Since Talanx is a company \nthat offers services in the areas of insurance and finance, the risks of \nphysical injury and accidents at work are relatively low. Equally, em\n-ployees are not exposed to significant health hazards. This applies to \nthe entire Talanx Group. As a result, the topic is not material accord\n-ing to the materiality analysis that we performed in the reporting \nperiod. At the same time, the safety and health of our employees \nwhile at work are naturally of the greatest importance to us. Our \n \nemployees are our capital and make a key contribution to our \n \nCompany™s success, which is why their well\n-being is a major compa\n-ny goal. For this reason, we report voluntarily on this topic. \n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines: \nIn Germany, we support our staff \nby providing active health management, a variety of sports offerings, \nmodern catering and customised advice. Occupational safety special\n-ists and company doctors serve our locations in Germany in line with \nthe statutory requirements. We safeguard our employees™ interests in \nwork safety and healthy workplaces in close cooperation with corpo\n-rate management, the works councils and the representatives of our \ncurrently 406 disabled employees.\nThe German Health and Safety at Work Act (ASiG) and the accident \nprevention regulations set out and regulate the statutory minimum \nstandards for this.\nIn the area of prevention, we take prophylactic measures to help pre\n-serve employees™ health and safety. This issue is very important at our \nCompany. Our objective is to continuously improve, and hence in\n-crease and optimise, health and safety standards so as to preserve and \nenhance our employees™ performance and motivation.\nIn line with this, our preventive activities include precautionary meas\n-ures and screening for diseases, as well as stress management and \n \nexercise offerings, and general health information. A number of loca\n-tions in Germany offer a wide range of health courses, from func\n-tional training through qigong and yoga down to massages.\nEmployees facing stressful personal, professional or health situations \ncan find their working capacity is severely impacted. This is why our \nCompany offers an external Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) \nthat enables employees to obtain professional advice by phone and, in \nindividual cases, personal discussions at their locations as well.\nDocumenting stress factors at work is becoming more and more im\n-portant. The data is collected by performing a hazard assessment us\n-ing the KFZA, an efficient short questionnaire for workplace analysis. \nThis provides the Group with important information on weaknesses \nand potential for improvement. \nThe risks associated with performing tasks are regularly assessed, and \nemployees trained on how to deal with them and provided with all the \ninformation they need. This also includes appointing teams of em\n-ployees in the various buildings who are responsible for implement\n-ing emergency measures and conducting training exercises (e.g. for \ndealing with pandemics or fires).\nBy organising health days at multiple sites, Talanx does justice to both \nthe strong demand, and the ongoing need, for health management \nmeasures. Health is an important motivational aspect both for em\n-ployees themselves and for their employer. Health days aim to sensi\n-tise employees for health issues and preventive measures, and hence \nto establish the topic as relevant for the enterprise. In particular, the \nevents are designed to strengthen and promote individuals™ health \nawareness. Health days are held regularly at all German locations, and \nin 2020 an overarching digital HDI Health Week was held for the first \ntime. \nThese measures are flanked by the sponsored employee sports pro\n-gramme, whose successful track record stretches back for years: \nTalanx uses it to strengthen team cohesion, facilitate employee con\n-tacts across different locations, and boost colleagues™ identification \nwith the Group. The goal of the sponsored programme is to boost \nboth employees™ motivation and their health, and to help retain staff \nfor the company.\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n We work continuously to \nenhance our occupational health and safety activities. Employers are \nobliged to take the measures necessary to ensure occupational safety, \ntaking into account the circumstances influencing employee health \nand safety at work. To do this, they must establish a suitable organisa\n-tion Œ an occupational health and safety system (see section 3 of the \nGerman Labour Protection Act (ArbSchG)). Our occupational safety \nspecialists and our works doctors support the responsible staff in our \ncompanies and encourage them to play an active role in ensuring oc\n-cupational safety. In line with the ArbSchG, the occupational safety \nspecialists advise us, as the employers, so as to ensure that occupa\n-tional health and safety is continuously enhanced and that occupa\n-tional safety regulations are observed. \n 403-2\n In the case of Talanx Group employees, accidents at work \nare broken down into in accidents that take place during work and \nthose that take place on the way to or from work (travel accidents). In \nGermany, accidents at work that result in more than three calendar \ndays™ work being lost must be reported to the relevant occupational \nhealth and safety agency or accident insurance fund by both the em\n-ployer and the attending physician. There were 8 (35) accidents at \nwork at the Talanx Group in Germany in 2020, corresponding to an \naccident at work ratio of approximately 0.1% (0.4%); in addition, there \nwere 8 (25) accidents on the way to or from work, corresponding to a \nratio of approximately 0.1% (0.3%). Our occupational safety special\n-ists assess the accidents in order to identify any preventive measures \nthat need to be taken.\n\n90Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nHealth@HDI: providing a balanced diet for employees\nOccupational health management is a key motivational tool at the \nTalanx Group and serves to maintain employees™ health and ability \nto work. \nNutrition Œ and hence the food we provide every day in our employee \ncanteens and cafés Œ plays a big role in maintaining our employees™ \nhealth and welfare. The challenge facing modern, forward\n-looking \n \ncatering is to offer staff the right amount of healthy meals that are \nfreshly prepared where possible. This naturally also has to take sus\n-tainability criteria into account, such as regional and seasonal pro\n-curement and ensuring animal welfare. In addition, daily vegetarian/\nvegan menus and cafeteria articles are provided. Organic German oat \nmilk is also available in the cafeterias at our Hannover and Cologne \nlocations as an alternative to normal milk. The works kitchens in \nHannover and Cologne have received JOB&amp;FIT certifications from the \nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung e.\n V. (DGE). In 2018, our employee \nrestaurants in Hannover won awards for their sustainable approach. \nIn Cologne, the canteen has also been certified to QCI organic stand\n-ards for many years and 80% of its food comes from certified organic \nfarms in the region. In Hannover, too, employees are provided with \nregionally sourced vegetables, fruit, dairy products and meat as part \nof a sustainable purchasing policy. \nAbove and beyond this, our nutrition scientists aim to reach out di\n-rectly to staff in order to raise awareness of healthy eating. A intranet \nplatform, HEALTH@HDI, has also been set up to promote this.

The specialist architects and \n \ndesigners had already implemented a number of sustainability \n \nprojects that had been awarded EDGE certification in the past. HDI \nSeguros decided to seek EDGE certification because this prescribes \nthe same sustainable procedures as the company already is already \nimplementing. In addition, a related app provides the architects and \nbuilding owners with the support and transparency they needed to \nconstruct a green, certified building that is both energy\n- and \n \nresource\n-friendly. The EDGE planning process is forecasting that the \nmeasures taken will result in energy and water savings of up to 20% \neach, plus savings of a further 20% in the energy needed to produce \nthe materials used (this is known as ﬁgrey energyﬂ or ﬁembodied \n \nenergyﬂ). All in all, this would yield total savings for the three planned \nbuildings of 117 t of CO\n2 per year. Joaquín Traslosheros, Finance Oper\n-ations Director, commented as follows: ﬁThe EDGE tool convinced us \n(in the center) David de la Vega, \nmaterial ressources manager, at \na meeting with his colleagues \n \nEduardo Cervantes and \n Rafael Martínes Cervantes.\nWorking sustainably\nIf the Group is to achieve its climate goals, it needs sustainable office \nbuildings and working environments in particular. HDI Seguros is \nnow focusing on ensuring a more agile organisation. And this in turn \nmeant a move to a larger, more modern and more sustainable build\n-ing. Especially as the old head office had become too small. ﬁWe \n \ndecided to build a new headquarters that will allow staff to work in \nboth an agile environment and a sustainable, certified buildingﬂ, said \nArmando Prieto, Chief Financial Officer. The new head office will be \nopened in the third quarter of 2021.\nArmando Prieto, the \nHDI Seguros Board \nmember responsible \nfor ˛nance and \nadministration, and \nJoaquín Traslosheros, \nhead of ˛nance, are \ndelighted at the \nfuture cost savings \nand positive environ\n-mental impact.\nEDGE CERTIFICATION Œ\n EXPECTED SAVINGS\n~ˆˆˇ.˘˜\nTCO\nˇ/YEAR\n˜˛%less energy \n˜˛%less water\n˜˛%less grey\n energy\n\n94Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nthat we have selected the right partner for our new headquarters. The \nteam worked successfully to construct a new office complex that is \nclearly sustainable.ﬂ\nTo ensure the new building could deliver on the planned savings, the \narchitects designed it to make optimum use of sunlight. This allows \nthe solar cells on the roofs to generate electricity extremely efficient\n-ly. In addition, trees and other plants are being planted, creating a \nmicro\n-environment that reduces the energy needed to cool the com\n-plex. Other sustainable design features include materials such as \n \nenergy-efficient lighting systems and an air conditioning system that \noffers energy savings of up to 20%. The use of double\n-glazing for win\n-dows and reflecting colours for the façades add a further 20% to the \nbuilding™s energy efficiency. Care is also being taken to ensure the \n \nefficient use of water during operations.\nNew ways of working\nHDI Seguros had originally planned to move in at the end of 2020. \nHowever, building work had to be suspended during the first wave of \nthe pandemic. And that wasn™t all: the coronavirus pandemic also led \nto new ways of working that raised questions about how staff would \ncollaborate once it was over. The goal during the planning phase was \nnot only to design a sustainable building but also to permit more \n agile cooperation.\nAgility and digital transformation are critical focus issues for the \nTalanx Group™s continued long\n-term success. Additionally, a broad\n-based initiative aims to promote agile thinking and working and \n \nanchor them throughout the company for the long term.

The certification programme was launched \nin 2014. EDGE supports the planning and certification of \nresource-friendly, carbon-neutral buildings. The organisa\n-tion helps construction companies, commercial property \nowners and investors with their planning by providing an \napp offering a standard for environmentally-friendly \nbuildings, a software application and certification in more \nthan 170 countries. Using the EDGE app can cut water and \nresource consumption by at least 20%. There are three \ncertification levels. Level 1 is reached if energy, water and \nembodied energy savings of 20% or more are achieved. \nLevel 2 applies to on-site energy savings of at least 40%. \nLevel 3 is awarded to sites that use 100% renewable \nenergy or purchase carbon offsets to top off at 100%. \nEDGE certification has saved 274,750 t of carbon \n \nemissions per year to date. For further information, \n see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://edgebuildings.com/nAs">https://edgebuildings.com\nAs</a> a result, the pandemic raised new questions, such as whether it \nwas necessary to rethink the working environment, since social dis\n-tancing and the increased use of videoconferences for virtual meet\n-ings have become the new normal. Should the workplaces in the new \nheadquarters building be adapted to produce hybrid working envi\n-ronments featuring fewer people in each room and greater digital \nconnectivity? The answer was a resounding ﬁyesﬂ. The reassessment \nhas led to more closed rooms for online meetings being added to the \nplanning. In addition, dedicated teamworking spaces and break \nrooms are vital for the new way of working, since they increase agility.\nThese new working methods also require more technology in the \nrooms so that staff can network with colleagues located remotely. \nHilde Schulz, Human Talent Director: ﬁIn the spirit of agility, we rapid\n-ly adapted the plans to reflect the new hybrid way of working.ﬂ Half of \nthe workplaces and meeting rooms will be equipped with permanent \nmonitors and a variety of connectivity options. This will make what \nwas already an attractive new building for employees even more inter\n-esting. In addition to enhancing agility, the new complex also reflects \nthe radical change in working methods. As a result, modifying the \nplanning led to an investment in the company™s sustainable future.\n\n96Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nDay-to-day\nOperations and\nProcurement\nManagement approach\nThe Talanx Group™s sustainability strategy also explicitly addresses \nour internal workflows and the wide range of external procurement \nprocesses that we launch as a company. Our commitment in these \nareas includes, for example, using resources sparingly, sourcing envi\n-ronmentally friendly products, respecting employee and human \nrights (including along the supply chain), and reducing our direct and \nindirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nOur environmental policy is part of Talanx™s sustainability strategy. \nWe aim to achieve continuous improvement and to comply with all \napplicable legal obligations and other requirements at all times. We \nalso encourage our employees to conserve resources and observe \nsustainability aspects in their daily work, and act as a role model for \nthem.The Talanx Group™s Code of Conduct, which is aimed at all employees, \nsets up\n-to\n-date standards for responsible, ethical behaviour at all \n \nlevels of the Group. Our new Code of Conduct for Business Partners, \nwhich is currently in the implementation phase, addresses the pro\n-curement process.\nClimate change\n 103-1\n Materiality:\n For us as a global insurance group, climate \nchange is a material sustainability aspect that has a significant impact \non all our business activities. Consequently, effective climate protec\n-tion is fundamental to our sustainability strategy. We want to help \nachieve a lower\n-emissions economy by putting climate protection at \nthe heart of our sustainability activities Œ in asset management, un\n-derwriting and environmental management alike.\nTopic Boundary: \nThe challenges posed by climate change affect the \nentire Talanx Group, including both the upstream and downstream \nstages in the process (see the ﬁValue chainﬂ graphic on \n page 9) and \nits key stakeholders: customers, business partners, investors and em\n-ployees. Climate aspects can potentially have negative effects on the \nCompany™s net assets, financial position and results of operations, and \non its reputation.\nWe design our day\n-to\n-day operations to \nbe sustainable and aim to ensure our \npurchasing activities focus continuously \nmore sustainable products and services.\n\n97Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nImpacts:\n Primary insurance and reinsurance of losses from natural \nhazards are an important element of our business model as a global \ninsurance group with a strong focus on industrial insurance and rein\n-surance. Consequently, climate change results in both opportunities \nand risks for us. On the one hand, demand for insurance against natu\n-ral hazards is likely to continue to increase, especially in previously \nunderinsured growth regions. On the other hand, the risk of a negative \nfinancial impact from losses that have occurred will also increase. As\n-sessing the probability of occurrence and impacts of natural disasters \nis becoming more difficult, since in the current exceptional climatic \nsituation historical data can only be used as inputs to a limited extent \n(see the section entitled ﬁRisks and opportunities due to climate \nchangeﬂ on  page 62 f.).  103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n This sustainability report de\n-scribes the measures that we have already taken to align our business \nprocesses more closely with sustainability criteria, and particularly \nwith aspects relating to the rapidly advancing process of climate \nchange. As already mentioned at the beginning, the three elements of \ninvestment, underwriting and environmental management play a key \nrole here. We provide detailed information on how our sustainability \nstrategy is being implemented in these three areas in the sections en\n-titled ﬁESG in asset managementﬂ (\n  page 63 ff.), ﬁESG in insurance \nsolutionsﬂ (\n  page 70 f.) and in this chapter, ﬁDay\n-to\n-day Operations \nand Procurementﬂ. In addition, we make use of our membership of rec\n-ognised initiatives and frameworks such as the UN Global Compact, \nthe PRI, the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initia\n-tive (UNEP FI)/PSI and the Allianz für Klima und Entwicklung (Alliance \nfor Climate and Development). This also applies to information shar\n-ing in regional/local networks, where we obtain input for enhancing \nTalanx™s sustainability strategy.\nMoreover, the Task Force on Climate\n-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD), which the Talanx Group has supported since the spring of \n2020, published dedicated recommendations for transparent, effec\n-tive corporate climate reporting in 2017. Among other things, the TCFD \nrequires companies to present their strategy for dealing with the risks \nand opportunities posed by climate change transparently to their \nshareholders and other stakeholders.\nResponsibilities:\n Given the complexity of the challenges resulting \nfrom climate change, the Board of Management and the divisions and \ndepartments within the Talanx Group share information on this sub\n-ject both regularly and on an ad hoc basis (see the ﬁSustainability and \ngovernanceﬂ section on \n page 19 ff.). Particularly important in this \ncontext are the Group™s two ESG bodies Œ the Responsible Investment \nCommittee (RIC) and the Responsible Underwriting Committee (RUC) \nŒ and the associated working groups that support the process of put\n-ting Talanx™s sustainability strategy into practice.\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring: \nSince climate change im\n-pacts a number of non\n-financial aspects, the related targets and meas\n-ures are primarily presented in the corresponding sections of the sus\n-tainability report. Since financial year 2019, operations at the Talanx \nGroup™s German locations have been carbon\n-neutral. After determin\n-ing its corporate carbon footprint in Germany, the Group offset \n \napproximately 25,000 metric tons of unavoidable carbon emissions \nusing two high\n-quality offset projects in Indonesia and Brazil (reforest\n-ation: REDD+; Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) &amp; Climate, Community \nand Biodiversity (CCBS) project). In addition, Talanx™s Board of \n \nManagement resolved during the reporting period that its global \n \noperations will be carbon\n-neutral by 2030 at the latest. \nTalanx™s approach is firstly to avoid and secondly to reduce green\n-house gases, and only in a third step to offset them.

As such, it has less impact on the environment than, for exam\n-ple, manufacturing companies or companies that are heavy users of \nraw materials. Nevertheless, the Group employs roughly 23,000 em\n-ployees at its locations around the world, and they consume energy \nand materials, take business trips and travel to and from work . In \naddition, the Group purchases products and operating materials that \nits employees need to do their jobs, such as paper, IT products and \nfood for its canteens. These aspects can impact the environment. \nTopic Boundary:\n Within the Talanx Group, sustainability in day\n-to\n-day operations is mainly relevant for Corporate Operations. In addi\n-tion, the consumption of materials and energy in particular is signif\n-icantly influenced by individual employee behaviour. The impacts of \nour core activities on the environment are dealt with in the chapter \nentitled ﬁInvestment and Insurance Productsﬂ (\n  page 55 ff.).Impacts:\n We aim to ensure that our day\n-to\n-day activities are focused \non sustainability by conserving resources, particularly in regard to \nenergy and water consumption and materials usage. Greenhouse gas \nemissions can primarily be reduced by ensuring that our employees \nuse environmentally friendly means of transport for travelling to and \nfrom work and for making business trips. In addition, we want to en\n-courage Talanx employees to conserve resources and be aware of the \nneed for sustainability in their day\n-to\n-day activities. The measures we \ntake therefore aim both to avoid negative impacts and to encourage \npositive impacts.\n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n The following chapter describes \nthe measures that we have already taken to align our day\n-to\n-day oper\n-ations more closely with sustainability criteria. A key focus in this \ncontext is on conserving resources, since a careful approach not only \nreduces pressure on the environment but can also significantly cut \noperating costs (for example by avoiding waste). It goes without \n \nsaying that all Group companies are interested in this Œ a fact that \nensures progress. \nKey measures taken include energy audits in accordance with DIN EN \n16247, in which our energy utilisation is systematically analysed in \norder to identify potential for improvements more easily; our partic\n-ipation in energy efficiency initiatives such as the Climate Alliance \nHannover 2030, Hannover ohne Plastik (HOP Œ ﬁHannover without \nPlasticﬂ) and the BREEAM In\n-Use certificates obtained for individual \nlocations. \nResponsibilities:\n A number of functions that are assigned to HDI \nService AG and HDI Systeme AG contribute to ensuring that day\n-to\n-day operations are designed in line with the principles of sustainabil\n-ity. Chief among them are Purchasing for the mobility product group \n(travel, vehicle fleet), IT Purchasing, Internal Services and Human \n Resources.\nInternal Services is responsible throughout Germany for pooling, co\n-ordinating and performing technical, infrastructure and sales sup\n-port services. This ensures that office operations run smoothly and \nreduces the workload of the sales units. The unit is responsible \namong other things for facility and lease management, setting up \nworkspaces, canteen operations and catering, fire protection, logis\n-tics, waste disposal and issues relating to heating, ventilation and air \nconditioning. Environmental and sustainability topics are taken into \naccount in a large number of areas.\nAmong other things, Human Resources Management organises \n \nofferings that allow employees to use local public transport at a \n \nreduced rate (group season tickets and ﬁJobTicketsﬂ); see also the sec\n-tion entitled ﬁEmployee Travel to and from Workﬂ, \n page 101). 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n The Talanx Group uses the \nresults of the materiality analysis, among other inputs, to develop the \nmanagement approach to be taken in the Day\n-to\n-day Operations and \nProcurement action area. This analysis takes the opinions of our \nstakeholders into account. In addition, Talanx has set itself concrete \ntargets for reducing emissions and energy consumption; see our sus\n-tainability goals (\n  page 22 ff.\n). We review the progress we are mak\n-ing towards achieving these goals on an ongoing basis. The energy \naudits in accordance with DIN EN 16247 that we perform in line with \nthe German Energy Services Act (EDL\n-G) also help here.\nWe are consciously using our participation in local initiatives such as \nthe ﬁClimate Alliance Hannoverﬂ and ﬁHannover ohne Plastikﬂ (HOP) \nto take stock of our situation, analyse our weaknesses and develop \nmeasures to improve our internal environmental management.\nThe sustainability community launched in 2020 offers staff through\n-out Germany an opportunity to network about sustainability issues. \nThe community met twice in the reporting period, with participants \naddressing a very wide range of different sustainability topics, from \nsetting up beehives through sustainable partnerships for vehicle in\n-surance down to organising a sustainable Christmas.\nWe also use the results of the ESG rating that we regularly undergo to \nenhance our internal environmental management.\n\n99Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nAs a responsible enterprise, the Talanx Group systematically captures \nthe resources used in its operations.

These include \ngreater integration of office and remote working, working time mod\n-els that are adapted to meet employees™ situations, and opportunities \nfor digital learning. These changes are becoming more and more of a \nfixture in modern, agile working environments and enhance both \nthe Company\'s attractiveness on the labour market and employee \nsatisfaction, loyalty and commitment.\nThe Talanx Group is helping employees get to work in an environ\n-mentally friendly way by subsidising local public transport offerings \nat a variety of locations in Germany. It aims to reduce the number of \ninternal business trips by making greater use of videoconferencing \ntechnology. This is another example of how the coronavirus pandem\n-ic has significantly accelerated developments and is impacting the \nworld of work within the Group. Far fewer to no business trips were \nmade in the reporting period, and employees mainly worked remote\n-ly or used hybrid forms comprising a combination of office and \n \nremote work. This had a strong impact on the carbon footprint deter\n-mined for financial year 2020 (especially Scopes 1 and 3).\nThe increasing digital transformation of the Talanx Group™s business \nmeans that a large number of business trips can already be avoided \nby making widespread use of videoconferencing technology at all \nour companies. However, since this is not possible in all cases, we are \ntaking steps in a number of areas to reduce the resulting emissions.\nTo promote environmentally friendly and hence low\n-carbon busi\n-ness travel in Germany, all employees who travel on business, and \nspecialists and executives who travel between our numerous Ger\n-man locations, receive a BahnCard business railcard for Deutsche \nBahn on request. A total of 368 (852) employees took advantage of \nthis offering in the reporting period; this figure also includes 7 (15) \nBahnCard 100 railcards that were chosen as alternatives to company \ncars. A total of 3,729,101 (12,950,307) person kilometres (pkm) were \ntravelled long\n-distance. Thanks to the bahn.business programme, \nTalanx employees travelling on Germany™s long\n-distance rail network \nuse 100% green electricity. Since bahn.business also offsets the indi\n-rect emissions, all long\n-distance travel using Deutsche Bahn is car\n-bon\n-neutral. This means that using Deutsche Bahn for long\n-distance \ntravel contributes to sustainable transport. A total of 286,608 \n(985,421) pkm were travelled locally. As with its long\n-distance rail net\n-work, Deutsche Bahn uses 100% green electricity in its local transport \noffering; as a result, indirect emissions in this area were offset, \n \ngenerating 0 (50,176) kg of CO\n2. We also further reduced our vehicle fleet emissions. Following last \nyear\'s revision of our rules on company cars, we continued our drive \nto increase e\n-mobility in the reporting period. In addition to the abil\n-ity to select hybrid\n-drive vehicles as company cars, the fleet now also \ncomprises a number of electrically powered cars for use on service \ntrips between locations. There are five outdoor charging stations, one \nof which can also be used by visitors, at HDI™s Hannover location. A \nfurther 14 stations are to be found next to parking spaces for compa\n-ny cars and employees™ electric vehicles. We are planning to almost \ndouble our charging stations by the end of 2021 in order to continue \nmeeting the growing need for charging infrastructure in the future, \ntoo. What is more, mail deliveries at the Group™s Hannover headquar\n-ters have been partially powered by electricity since April 2017. Talanx \nwas one of the first companies in Germany to acquire an e\n-scooter \ndeveloped by Deutsche Post. This saves approximately 1.7 metric tons \nof CO\n2 in the course of a year. What is more, carbon offsetting has \nbeen performed for company cars since 2020, with 1,760 metric tons \nbeing \n offset via a Gold Standard climate project. \nThe section on our sustainability goals gives a full overview of the \ngoals and measures that Talanx has adopted in order to reduce emis\n-sions. (\n  page 21). 305-5\n  Employee travel to and from work\nWe offer employees at different locations in Germany subsidies if \nthey use local public transport so as to promote environmentally \nfriendly travel to and from work: in more detail, staff can purchase \ngroup season tickets in Hannover and ﬁJobTicketsﬂ in Cologne, \nHilden, Hamburg, Düsseldorf and Rostock. \nIn Hannover, 1,056 (1,195) employees Œ around 29% (36%) of eligible \nemployees there Œ had signed up for the group season ticket as at \n31˜December 2020.

Since the JobTicket in Cologne is collectively \nfinanced, the costs are determined on an annual basis and allocated \nto all users. The current take\n-up rate is around 51% (64%). At neue leb\n-en insurers™ location in Hamburg, a total of 168 (192) employees used \nthe HVV ProfiCard offered by Hamburg™s public transport association \nas at December 2020. This corresponds to roughly 29% (62%) of the \nworkforce. A total of 45 (73) people Œ roughly 7% (12%) of employees Œ \nat our Hilden location had a JobTicket as at the end of the year, while \n13 (21) people Œ roughly 10% (16%) of the workforce Œ at our Düsseldorf \nsite use a JobTicket. At our Rostock location, 85 HDI next GmbH \n \nemployees acquired a JobTicket for the first time; this corresponds to \nroughly 61% of those eligible. In some cases, employees who use the \nticket also receive a travel allowance from their employer.\nAs was the case last year, five Talanx Group locations Œ Hamburg, \nHannover, Hilden, Cologne and Stuttgart Œ took part in the nation\n-wide ﬁCity Cycling 2020ﬂ competition, supporting their municipali\n-ties in the race to become the ﬁmost active cycling region in Germa\n-nyﬂ. The City Cycling initiative aims to help protect the climate, cut \ncarbon emissions and send a signal to local municipalities that they \nshould promote greater use of bicycles Œ all while having fun cycling. \nThe teams at our locations got in gear again in 2020 in the truest \nsense of the word.\nOur Hilden location has been certified as a cycle\n-friendly employer \nand awarded a silver certificate. Since 2017, German cycling club \nADFC has been responsible for awarding certificates under the new, \nEU-wide ﬁCycle\n-friendly Employerﬂ scheme. Companies can score \npoints by adopting cycle\n-friendly measures that are set out in a cata\n-logue of measures, leading to the award of bronze, silver or gold cer\n-tificates. An ADFC employee conducted the first on\n-site audit. The \ncertificate is valid for three years before needing renewal.\nGreenhouse gas emissions by scope\nOur greenhouse gas emissions reporting is based on the globally \n \naccepted methodology used in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG \nProtocol). In line with this methodology, greenhouse gas emissions \nare broken down into three categories, known as scopes. We base our \nemissions calculations on conversion factors for the underlying pro\n-cesses from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the United \nKingdom™s DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural \n \nAffairs). Output amounts are expressed in metric tons of CO\n2 equiva\n-lents. This means that other greenhouse gases that are emitted (such \nas CH4 and N2O) are included in the calculations on the basis of their \nenvironmental impact in proportion to CO\n2. Applying the emission \nfactors enables us to approximate the emissions actually generated. \n 305-1\n Scope 1 emissions \nOur Scope 1 emissions consist of emissions resulting from combus\n-tion processes within the organisation. These are generated, for ex\n-ample, in the case of local (oil\n- or natural gas\n-fired) heating plants and \nour vehicle fleet. \nSCOPE ˜ EMISSIONS Œ GERMANY\ntCO\n2e20202019Scope 1 Heating\n968602Scope 1 Vehicle ˚eet\n1,8412,711Total\n2,8093,313SCOPE ˜ EMISSIONS Œ REST OF WORLD\ntCO\n2e20202019Scope 1 Heating\n5,502607Scope 1 Vehicle ˚eet\n22,82824,595Total\n 128,33025,2021  \n2020: The increase in Scope 1 (heating) is due to the expansion of data collection \n to additional countries.

This means that data coverage amounts to &gt; 53%; \n2019: Chile and the USA are not included in the Scope 1 emissions given for the \n companies abroad.\n 305-2\n Scope 2 emissions \nOur Scope 2 emissions comprise emissions from purchased electrici\n-ty and purchased heating energy generated by district heating. The \ncalculations are based on the country\n-specific emission factors, \nwhich can vary widely depending on the primary sources of energy \nused to generate power and district heating. This can lead in some \ncases to major differences in the specific emissions produced. For ex\n-ample, the proportion of renewable energy included in Austria™s pow\n-er grid is the highest in Europe, at over 70%. This means that local \npower consumption is less CO\n2-intensive. Since up\n-to\n-date figures are \nnot available for all countries, conservative estimates based on past \nfigures were made in certain cases. In Germany, our activities as an \ninvestor in infrastructure projects are also directly promoting the \nshift in energy generation towards green energy (see also \n page 65).\n103Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nSCOPE ˛ EMISSIONS Œ GERMANY\ntCO\n2e20202019Scope 2 Electricity\n9,33410,228Scope 2 District heating\n3,9537,027Total\n13,28717,255SCOPE ˛ EMISSIONS Œ REST OF WORLD\n ˜tCO\n2e20202019Scope 2 Electricity\n28,18622,712Scope 2 District heating\n651581Total\n28,83723,2931  \n2020: No data available for Belgium, Great Britain, Hungary and Switzerland.

No claim to completeness can be made for the Scope 3 emis\n-sions due to the complexity and extremely large number of process\n-es inferred. The objective is simply to give a rough idea of the addi\n-tional environmental impacts resulting from our business activities. \nThe following processes were taken into account when calculating \nthe figures: emissions from water supplies and water treatment, the \nproduction of motor and heating fuels, transport, paper production, \nbusiness travel (air and rail), emissions resulting from the production \nof the energy used to generate electricity and district heating, and \nlosses in the supply network. Work is currently underway to record \nhow employees travel to the workplace (commuting behaviour).\nSCOPE ˝ EMISSIONS\ntCO\n2e20202019Scope 3\n 18,82018,8141  \nThe ˜gures were calculated using the conversion factors for the underlying processes \navailable from DEFRA and the IEA. Business travel using Deutsche Bahn™s long-distance rail \nnetwork has been climate-neutral since January 2018, since 2020 also DB\'s local transport. \n2020: No data available for Austria, Chile, Great Britain, Poland and Switzerland (data \ncoverage in relation to employees covered in the report &gt; 77%); 2019: 100% coverage.\nMaterials used and waste\n 301-1| 301-2\n The main way in which the materials used topic affects \nthe Talanx Group, as a provider of services in the areas of insurance \nand finance, is in relation to paper. The volume of other materials \nused in the production of insurance cover and other services is not \nsignificant. For this reason, reducing paper consumption and using \nenvironmentally friendly paper is a key lever in making our business \nmore sustainable.\nSince the most environmentally friendly solution is to dispense with \nprinting altogether, the Talanx Group is increasingly focusing on digi\n-tal solutions. For example, HDI Austria is increasingly transmitting \ndata electronically in order to be able to cut the amount of paper con\n-sumed. In Germany, even confidential documents can now be ex\n-changed securely by e\n-mail in a manner that meets all data protection \nrequirements using sophisticated encryption algorithms. The recipi\n-ent receives the key required for this via a separate digital channel (e.g. \nas an SMS). This ensures that the document can only be read by the \nperson for whom it is actually intended. The Talanx Group aims to \nexpand its use of this and other options in the medium term. Since \nthe middle of 2016, our quarterly reports and quarterly statements \nhave been made available solely in electronic form. In addition, cen\n-tralised, customised printing on demand has now replaced conven\n-tional printing of customer brochures and materials. This prevents \nany remaining stocks having to be destroyed when the brochures are \nrevised and hence avoids large volumes of paper being wasted. Cen\n-tralising our printing does not simply save paper, though: it also saves \ntime and money, thanks to the postage discounts we receive from \nDeutsche Post. Since 1 November 2020, all documents to be sent by \npost have been produced by an external service provider operating at \nfour locations in Germany. We provide the different locations with the \ndatasets for printing based on a regional perspective, and hence shift \na large proportion of the distance travelled away from the motorways \nand onto the data highway.\nThe Talanx Group™s ﬁDigital, not paperﬂ campaign aims to get the dis\n-patchers of post that does not have to be in physical form (e.g. adver\n-tising mailshots, catalogues and seminar documents) to transition to \na digital format (e\n-mail) and also to only use the documents digitally \nthemselves. This gives Talanx employees simple, direct e\n-mail access \nand complete flexibility, including when working remotely, while also \nhelping to conserve the environment.\nIn January 2021, we also discontinued automatically printing the \nterms and conditions when documenting or updating retail property \ninsurance policies (primarily private liability insurance, homeowners™ \ninsurance, residential property insurance and accident insurance). \nThis saves approximately 14 pages per individual operation. All in all, \nmore than two million pages of paper and roughly EUR 150,000 in \nprinting and postage costs are saved per annum.\nIn addition, we rolled out a module permitting central printing from \nthe office or remote workplace at the Group at the beginning of March \n2020. This reduces effort and leverages the advantages of printing at \nfour locations.\n\n104Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nHowever, since printing cannot be avoided entirely, Talanx focuses \non a number of sustainability labels when procuring its materials. To \ndate, the paper used for printing has been awarded the Forest Stew\n-ardship Council (FSC) label, and the same goes for all envelopes used. \nThis certifies that paper has been sourced from sustainable, responsi\n-bly managed forests. Paper of this kind is used in our offices and for \ninvoices, insurance policies, customer documents, brochures and an\n-nual reports. We have used climate\n-neutral printing for the latter \nsince 2015. In addition, our sustainability reports are available solely \nin electronic form.\nOFFICE PAPER CONSUMPTION BY CORE WORKFORCE\n ˜Metric tons\n20202019Paper consumption\n5388391  \n2020: No data available for France (data coverage related to employees covered in the report \n&gt; 99%); 2019: 100% coverage.\nWhat is more, a large number of documents in Germany were printed \nin our in-house print centre in Hannover, which serves all our \n \nGerman operating units, in the reporting period. Approximately 51.5 \n(56.7) million sheets of paper (roughly 257 (283.5) metric tons) were \nused by the centre and our external service provider in the reporting \nperiod, a further reduction. Roughly 98% of the copy paper used was \nFSC-certified. Double\n-sided printing is also the prescribed standard at \nour locations. At present, the remaining printed paper used is still \nsourced from, and processed at, various printing companies at the \nrequest of the departments concerned. Here, too, we are currently \n \nexamining whether centralised printing by our print centre would \nimprove sustainability. \nInitiatives aimed at digitalising communications will be stepped up \nacross all lines in 2021.\nLast but not least, we continue to focus on energy and paper con\n-sumption in our internal communications. The goal is to sensitise \nemployees to the contribution that they can make to conserving \n \nresources, for example by printing fewer documents. \nOur employees in Germany used approximately 1 (0.7) metric ton of \ntoner cartridges in the reporting period.\n 306-1 | 306-2\n Avoiding waste is a key element in the sustainability \nstrategy for our own day\n-to\n-day operations. Among other things, \nTalanx helps reduce waste within the enterprise by recycling and by \nimplementing a plastic avoidance policy. \nThe waste generated by the Talanx Group primarily consists of resid\n-ual waste, office waste and kitchen waste. A large proportion of this \ncan be recycled by local waste disposal companies. This applies in \nparticular to paper and plastic waste. Some of our kitchen waste is \ncomposted, while at our major locations some is used for energy \n \nrecovery where possible. For example, roughly 115 (135) m³ of organic \nwaste in Hannover and roughly 111 (144.5) m³ in Cologne was pro\n-cessed in biogas plants in the reporting period. The remaining (non\n-IT) residual waste is also disposed of by regional waste disposal com\n-panies and in some cases is treated at a mechanical\n-biological waste \ntreatment plant (partly above\n-ground landfill, partly energy recov\n-ery). Our business only generates small volumes of hazardous waste \nand electronic waste; this is disposed of in compliance with all the \nrelevant regulations by specialised waste management companies.\nAt the beginning of 2021, waste disposal at our central locations in \nHannover and Cologne switched to using central waste bins. Discon\n-tinuing the individual office wastebaskets, which had separate sec\n-tions for residual waste and which used plastic bags, will make a \n \nfurther significant contribution to reducing plastic waste at our \nbuildings: this saves a good 750,000 plastic bags a year. Our plastic \navoidance policy forms part of the Group™s operational sustainability \nstrategy and also supports the ﬁHannover ohne Plastikﬂ (HOP) sus\n-tainability initiative, which HDI signed up to at the end of 2019. Our \nHilden location also implemented a waste disposal concept that uses \nfewer plastic bags.\nWASTE (GERMANY)\n ˜Waste in metric tons\n%2020201920202019Recycling\n8991,45442.355.5Energy recovery (kitchen/food waste)\n53447225.118.0Composting\n187638.82.4Residual waste (non-IT)\n49461223.223.4Electronic waste (small and large electronic devices)\n220.10.1Hazardous waste\n10150.50.6Total waste\n2,1262,617100.0100Waste per employee\n0.20.2ŠŠ1  \nDeviations between the current data and the ˜gures for previous years cannot be ruled out, since the boundaries of the report are constantly being expanded.

Although we consider the risk of human rights abuses \nand of significant negative environmental impacts in our supply \nchain to be minor, we take care when selecting suppliers to ensure \nthat they comply with national legislation on environmental protec\n-tion and human rights, and with our Talanx Values. Social questions \nare relevant for procurement in particular; examples include the \nconditions under which people in our value chain work and whether \nhuman rights are respected. For this reason, the Group™s sustainabil\n-ity strategy aims to design its day\n-to\n-day operations and purchasing \nactivities for sustainability.\nTopic Boundary:\n Within the Talanx Group, the topic of sustainable \nprocurement is mainly relevant to the Group functions responsible \nfor purchasing (non\n-IT) products and services and for IT purchasing. \nOutside the Group it mainly impacts the suppliers with whom we \nwork. \nImpacts:\n We can make a significant contribution to sustainable de\n-velopment by integrating sustainability criteria into our purchasing \noperations. Among other things, this includes Talanx sourcing envi\n-ronmentally friendly products and ensuring that environmental cri\n-teria are taken into account in the supply chain, and that employee \nrights and human rights are observed.\n 103-2\n Measures and guidelines:\n We developed a uniform Group\n-wide\n  Code of Conduct for Business Partners\n in order to under\n-score our commitment to national environmental legislation on \nenvironmental protection and respect for human rights, and to up\n-holding our Talanx Values, and to be able to exert a positive influ\n-ence over and above the legal requirements. This was resolved by \nTalanx™s Board of Management. The document covers both IT and \nNon-IT Purchasing and sets out binding rules on the following top\n-ics: anti\n-corruption and bribery matters, respect for human rights, \nenvironmental, social and other employee matters, data protection \nand the protection of business secrets. The new code is currently be\n-ing implemented in the individual divisions. For example, IT Pur\n-chasing already issued a new invitation to tender for IT service pro\n-viders in 2020, which included successfully piloting the use of the \nnew code. As a result, the code has been incorporated in the new \nmaster agreements with all preferred and qualified business part\n-ners for IT services. \nResponsibilities:\n Purchasing is responsible for ensuring that con\n-tracts are drafted in a cost\n-efficient and timely manner that takes \naccount of the latest requirements, and also organises the procure\n-ment of goods and services for the German Group companies. \n \nResponsibility for procuring IT products and services has been \n \nassigned to IT Purchasing, Provider and Licence Management.\n 103-2 | 103-3\n Results and monitoring:\n The Purchasing (IT and \nNon-IT) function is extremely important for the company™s success. \nThis is why internal work instructions are used to define binding \npurchasing standards for the Talanx Group, so as to ensure that it \nhas orderly and efficient procurement processes. These make a sig\n-nificant contribution to our ability to reach our corporate goals and \nensure compliance. Only authorised organisational units may \n \nengage in procurement. In addition, compliance with internal guide\n-lines and work instructions is checked during our regular internal \naudits.\n\n106Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nCompliance and Transparency\nInvestment and Insurance Products\nWork and Employees\nDay-to-day Operations and Procurement\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nEnvironmental protection in supplier management \n 204-1 | 308-1 | 308-2\n The Talanx Group primarily uses domestic sup\n-pliers when procuring products and operating materials. These are \nsubject to the same strict statutory requirements as Talanx itself. It is \ntherefore unlikely that there are significant negative environmental \nimpacts in the Group™s supply chain. At the same time, we take care to \nensure that the impacts caused by our procurement processes are \nkept to a minimum. We see procurement from regional suppliers as \none key aspect of this, to the extent that it promotes sustainability. \nFor our German sites, we define regional suppliers as companies that \nare located in the same place, since this keeps transport distances \nshort. In Germany, roughly 45% (40%) of our suppliers of operating \nequipment and foodstuffs fall within this category, as do roughly 26% \n(22%) of our IT suppliers. Our foreign companies generally define re\n-gional suppliers as companies domiciled in the country concerned. \nOnly in the area of IT purchasing were there some cases of cross\n-bor\n-der supply agreements. We also pay attention to the environmental \ncompatibility of our materials and almost exclusively source paper \nfrom sustainably managed forests (FSC label); in addition, we source \ncertified organic food for our company canteens to a certain extent.\nTalanx developed its Code of Conduct for Business Partners so as to \nbe able to increase its focus on environmental criteria going forward, \nand to apply these systematically when selecting suppliers. The new\n  code\n is currently being implemented in the individual divisions. \nThe Code covers both IT and Non\n-IT Purchasing and sets out binding \nrules on the following topics: anti\n-corruption and bribery matters, \nrespect for human rights, environmental, social and other employee \nmatters, data protection and the protection of business secrets.\nIn addition, Purchasing™s ﬁGreen Officeﬂ catalogue of environmental\n-ly friendly office materials has been providing concrete support for \nthe Talanx Group™s sustainability strategy since the autumn of 2018. \nOur supplier, a company called memo, is a pioneer in this area in \n \nGermany and only distributes sustainable products that have been \nproduced in a socially responsible way. The ﬁGreen Officeﬂ range \navailable from the procurement portal is intended to be a green alter\n-native to the established catalogue of office materials.\nLabour practices and respect for \n human rights at suppliers \n 407-1 | 408-1 | 409-1 | 414-1 | 414-2\n Talanx™s Non\n-IT Purchasing unit \nlargely uses domestic suppliers. As such, they are subject to German \njurisdiction, and in particular to German employment laws. Conse\n-quently, Talanx has not performed a separate review to date to deter\n-mine whether its suppliers comply with labour practices, whether \nthey violate or endanger the right to freedom of association, collec\n-tive bargaining or human rights, whether they pose the risk of child, \nforced and compulsory labour or whether they impact on society. \nEqually, it is not expected that existing supplier relationships in the \narea of IT procurement violate or endanger these aspects. Moreover, \nthe  Code of Conduct for IT Contractors\n, which covers labour prac\n-tices, human rights, environmental protection and ethical standards, \napplies to these relationships (see the previous section).\nOur Group\n-wide Code of Conduct, which is available in nine languages, \nis an effective way of making our commitment to complying with the \napplicable laws transparent. The\n  Code of Conduct\n for \n Employees \nwas updated during the reporting period and formulates fundamen\n-tal legal and ethical requirements and duties that our staff have to \nabide by during their work. It highlights the ban on money laundering \nand illegal financing, and expressly draws attention to the fact that \nthe competent anti\n-money laundering officer and compliance officer \nmust be informed of all suspected cases. It also sets out specific rules \nof conduct covering, among other things, avoiding and disclosing \nconflicts of interest; granting and accepting benefits, gifts and invita\n-tions; donations and sponsorships; sideline activities; equity interests \nin other companies and participations in transactions.\nHere, too, we should mention the Group™s uniform\n  Code of \n \nConduct for Business Partners\n which was resolved by Talanx™s Board \nof Management and for which the roll\n-out started in the reporting \nperiod.\n\n107Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\n Further Information\nPAGE\nAbout this report\n 108Standards and Guidelines\n 112GRI content index\n 115TCFD content index\n 121Contact information\n 122\n108Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nAbout this report\nStandards and Guidelines\nGRI content index\nTCFD Index\nContact information\nAbout this report\n 102-52 | 102-54\n The Talanx Group uses this sustainability report to \nprovide comprehensive information on ESG topics. The report was \nprepared in accordance with the GRI Standards™ Core option. In some \ncases, however, the information provided goes beyond the scope of \nthe Core option, for example because the report is also designed to \nmeet the information requirements of relevant ESG ratings that have \na sustainability focus. The Talanx Group has published a sustainabil\n-ity report annually since 2015.\nThe GRI content index (\n  page 115ff.) provides an overview of all GRI \ntopics and indicators contained in this report; the links between the \nUN™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the relevant meas\n-ures taken by Talanx can be found on\n  page 34 f. Our sustainability \ngoals are listed on \n page 22 ff. The references and symbols used are \nexplained in the key on\n  page 1.One important basis for this report and for our sustainability strate\n-gy are two stakeholder surveys that were conducted in 2014 and 2018 \namong employees, customers, intermediaries and business partners, \ninvestors and analysts, politicians and representatives of NGOs, asso\n-ciations, research institutions, the media and society; see the section \nentitled ﬁMateriality analysisﬂ (\n  page 26 ff.). We conducted our \n \nmateriality analysis in accordance with the principles for defining \n \nreport content set out in the GRI and the German Commercial Code \n(HGB), as amended by the German CSR Directive Implementing Act \n(CSR-RUG).Sustainability context: \nThis report presents the Talanx Group™s ac\n-tivities and achievements in the wider context of sustainable devel\n-opment. To do this, we identified the relevant topics using not only \nthe list of GRI indicators, but also a wide range of different literature, \nsustainability studies and initiatives, and the criteria applied in ESG \nratings.\nMateriality:\n In line with the GRI Standards and the HGB, the report \ncovers those topics that\n Show Talanx™s significant economic, environmental \n and social impacts \n Substantively influence our stakeholders™ assessments \n and decisions and \n Are highly relevant for our business success. \nIn order to ensure the materiality of the report content, we include \ntopics that have been identified as particularly important on an \n \naggregate basis both by the stakeholders surveyed and by Talanx™s \ninternal Sustainability Competence Team. We also report on those \ntopics that our key stakeholder groups consider to be particularly \n \nimportant. Details of these topics can be found in the overview of \nmaterial and additional topics (\n  page 30 f.).Completeness: \nOur report aims to cover all topics that are relevant to \nTalanx as an insurance group. To ensure this is the case, we verified \nthe priorities for the topics after they had been assigned by compar\n-ing them again with the sources used to identify them and to prepare \nthe questionnaire. We also reviewed the sustainability information \npublished by other financial services and insurance companies and \nsector\n-specific studies to ensure that we had not left any topics out. \nAdditionally, the results of the materiality analysis were discussed by \nthe Board of Management.\nStakeholder inclusiveness:\n This report identifies the stakeholders \nwho play a role for Talanx and the topics that are important to them. \nAs far as possible we also report on those topics. In addition to our \n \ndirect stakeholder survey, we have taken stakeholder interests into \n \naccount by using studies, initiatives and ESG ratings to identify the \ntopics. Last but not least, the report is structured in accordance with \nthe GRI Standards, which are the result of a multi\n-stakeholder process.\nSince 2017, the data for the sustainability report has been collated \n \nusing a comprehensive data capture system. Due to this new soft\n-ware\n-based method of collating data and the continuous expansion \nof the report boundaries, deviations between the current data and \nthe figures for previous years cannot be ruled out. The change in the \ndata capture processes and calculation methodology means that the \ndirect comparability of the annual data cannot be fully guaranteed. \nSignificant deviations to the prior\n-year figures are explained in foot\n-notes. \nFurther\n Information\n\n109Sustainability Report 2020\nOur Organisation\nSustainability Strategy and Management\nAction Areas\nTCFD Reporting\nFurther Information\nAbout this report\nStandards and Guidelines\nGRI content index\nTCFD Index\nContact information\nSection 315b(1) in conjunction with section 315c/section 289c of the \nHGB requires the Talanx Group to prepare a consolidated non\n-finan-cial statement.
